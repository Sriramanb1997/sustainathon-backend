a tale of a wolf pack that the Grasslands trust was tracking Indian grey wolf is a subspecies of the Eurasian wolf which is under the threat of getting wiped out This film reveals a great danger that has emerged in the form of disease transmission from the free ranging dogs to the wildlife especially the wild canid species This video was produced for spreading the awareness about our neglected Savanna ecosystems and the precious wildlife it supports like the Indian wolf which acts as a key stone umbrella species for the landscape Canine Distemper virus is a fatal virus that affects wildlife universally The film highlights the extent of the impact of this virus on the Wolves With entire packs being wiped out the film shows how local extinction is an imminent threat considering these populations are isolated We greatly thank RESQ charitable trust and Ecodaund for quick rescue of the wolves from the field and the treatment and diagnosis at the rescue centre Also shading light on the CDV cases and sharing their knowledge on the topic We are thankful to Nature in Focus NIF who have awarded this film Winner in the ConservationProfessional category of Nature in Focus Film Awards

wolfpunegmailcom Film synopsis As a young group of nature enthusiasts and photographers we regularly roamed these less explored areas on Grasslands in search of birds and mammals A chance spotting of a pack of Indian Wolves Canis lupus in 2009 paved the way for this initiative We wanted to know more about this elusive grassland predator Indian Wolf Canis lupus which is a Schedule 1 Species under Wild Life Protection Act 1972 Over the course of the next decade we scourged these grasslands for all signs of life and interacted extensively with the Dhangar Nomadic Tribe communities to know more about these grasslands What we found was simply staggering Over these mostly unprotected lands lay hidden a virtual treasure trove of Wild Wonders There are more than 350 species of Birds 25 species of Mammals in the grasslands of Maharashtra India We felt it was a story that needed to be told This film was created by us with the sole aim of creating awareness about this astonishing wildlife diversity that thrives just 30 minutes away from one of Indias largest city of Pune Maharashtra India and also the various threats that endanger this fragile wonderland pune saswad
