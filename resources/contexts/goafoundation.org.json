mining This has involved advocacy with a variety of Indian and international entities on a number of related issues We have also joined a number of coalitions as well as foundedcofounded a few This page archives some key aspects of our work on mining in beyond Goa At the heart of our work is the shared inheritance paradigm In essence we see natural resources including minerals as a shared inheritance where the state is owner of these minerals as a trustee on behalf of the people and especially future generations The intergenerational equity principle asks us to ensure our children and future generations inherit at least as much as we did And mining is eventually the sale of the shared inheritance of minerals and the depletion of a bunch of related inheritances Global Advocacy UNEP on Mineral Resource Governance In response to a UNEP consultation we submitted this eight page summary of how mineral resources should be managed with an intergenerational equity perspective 2020 UN Working Group on Business Human Rights In response to a consultation on Extractive sector just transition and human rights by the UN Working Group on Business Human Rights we submitted this six page summary of how mineral resource management violates human rights and how they should be managed 2023 Ethical Government Accounting This is a strand of work that is potentially our most important We are trying to change the way governments account and report on their management of inherited mineral wealth In summary we argue that minerals should be reported as an asset prior to extraction mineral sale proceeds resulting from extraction or sale should be recorded as capital receipts not revenue and the loss if any should be recorded as an expense At a deeper level we argue for viewing minerals as a shared inheritance not as a source of windfall revenue Finally we have proposed the Goa Foundation Benchmark for evaluating the management of mineral wealth The Goa Foundation benchmark has three parts a sell the minerals with zero loss in value b save the entire sale proceeds in a future generations fund invested in a global portfolio of low cost mutual funds and c distribute only the real income as a citizens dividend equally to all It is easy to demonstrate that the Goa Foundation benchmark outperforms the Strong Pareto Improvement as everyone is better off without any redistribution of wealth or income This work began in 2016 with a note that was sent to the IMF World Bank UN Statistics IPSASB INTOSAI as well as Indias MoF MoSPI CAG CGA etc We have also joined the global Capitals Coalition Mitigating the Resource Curse by Improved Government Accounting 2016 Government accounting and the Resource Curse Response to FAQs 2017 Letter to IMF Managing Director on the Arctic Refuge USA 2018 Letter to UN Committee of Experts on EnvironmentalEconomic Accounting UNCEEA 2018 This research led to an academic paper coauthored by our Research Director Rahul Basu Scott Pegg titled

data on the extent of natural forests in Goa that is put out by the Forest Department Government of Goa It has filed several PIL writ petitions for cancellation of projects approved for areas which have unidentified forests The most celebrated of these involves the plot purchased by DLF for a luxury housing project at Chicalim A SHORT HISTORY OF JUDICIAL INTERVENTION In 1990 a division bench of the Bombay High Court at Panaji ruled that private forests are also covered by the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act 1980 Pursuant to that judgement the forest department of Goa drew up criteria to identify forests in the state of Goa These criteria were not approved by the state government or by the Ministry of Environment and Forests The latter implements the Forest Conservation Act 1980 The criteria later became a bone of contention between the GF and the authorities In 1996 the Supreme Court of India passed an order similar to the 1990 judgement of the Bombay High Court which ensured that forests all over the country whatever the ownership would be covered by the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act 1980 Thus the apex court practically applied the Bombay High Court judgement from Goa to the entire country The Supreme Court in its 1996 order directed all state governments to set up Expert Committees to identify natural forests including degraded forest lands in individual states The terms of reference given by the Supreme Court order include the following 1 Identify areas which are forests irrespective of whether they are so notified recognised or classified under any law and irrespective of the ownership of the land of such forest 2 Identify areas which were earlier forests but stand degraded denuded or cleared 3 Identify areas covered by plantation trees belonging to the Government and those belonging to private persons SAWANT AND KARAPURKAR COMMITTEES In Goa the government set up what is known as the Sawant Committee named after its Chairperson Mr S M Sawant to identify private forests in the state The Sawant Committee identified 40 sq km of private forest Since its work was not completed before it decided to close shop the Goa Government appointed a successor committee headed by HY Karapurkar which identified another 27 sq km of private forests Pursuant to the work of the two committees a total of 67 sq km of private forests was identified Reports of these committees can be downloaded here The Goa Foundation moved the High Court to ensure that no land falling in the 67 sq km would be permitted for development or change in land use without prior approval under the Forest Conservation Act 1980 Prayer was granted The two committees headed by SawantKarapurkar together did not complete the identification process which led to some serious forest damage Since large areas of private forest remained unidentified town planning authorities continued to grant permissions for development in those areas The following writ petitions deal with cases where the land was forest yet development permissions were granted the most notorious case being the DLF project at Chicalim IT Park Application No24 THC2013 NGT at Pune Challenge to the proposal to set up an IT park by Infotech at Socorro and Salvador do Mundo villages Ela Application No 25 THC2013 NGT at Pune Challenge to housing in forest area at Ela Sancoale Application No 37 THC2013 NGT at Pune Challenge to housing in forest area of Sancoale Bethora Application No19 THC2013 NGT at Pune Challenge to housing in forest area of Bethora DLF Application No26 THC2013 NGT at Pune Challenge to DLF housing in forest area and on steep slope at Chicalim The pressing task now was to get the remaining private forests identified So the Goa Foundation filed another PIL writ petition asking for setting up of fresh committees to complete the directions given in the Supreme Courts order of 12121996 Due to the petition two committees were set up one for north and another for south Goa Both committees did hardly any work because of noncooperation from the Goa Land Survey department After a period of two years the Foundation got fresh committees appointed and these have commenced their work quite seriously and made considerable progress Their reports are posted here The work is now complete How much of private natural forests remain to be identified The state government itself had estimated that some 200 sq km of private forests existed in the state of Goa However according to the Forest Survey of India total forest in the state of Goa covers 58 of the land area This practically means approximately another 1000 sqkm of forest remained unidentified The discrepancy is due to the different criteria adopted by the Forest Department of Goa and the FSI The Goa forest department following its criteria has systematically excluded lands with canopy density of less than 40 and areas less than 5 hectare from the definition of forest The Forest Survey of India on the other hand in its definition of forests includes a category called open forest which includes forests with canopy density of 10 and above This definition has become the basis for the Supreme Court order dated 3032008 which sets out NPV values for lands allowed for diversion The Forest Survey of India has also defined a forest in terms of one hectare and above and not 5 hectare and above as decided by the Goa Government Thus the Goa Foundation had to move the High Court again and again to restrain projects in areas where the density was above 10 and in excess of one hectare Adinterim relief was granted restraining the Collector from granting any conversion sanad where the plot is above 1 hectare and having 10 density and above The Goa Foundation also moved the High Court with a PIL writ petition for demarcation of the 67 sq km of private forests on the ground The government came back with a ground verification report stating that there were many errors in the Sawant and Karapurkar committee reports and as a result of ground truthing the extent of forest according to their demarcation on the ground was only 3000 hectares 30 sq km This workreport was challenged by the Goa Foundation in a fresh writ petition on the grounds that the forest department had not been asked to verify whether there was a forest on a particular survey number or not but to only survey those lands which the two earlier committees had declared were having part forests and then to have these demarcated on the ground At the time of identification of these private forests from 1997 to 2000 the two committees had found forests on them Hence those areas would remain forest lands even if the forest had been illegally removed in the meantime by the land owners in question The High Court petition challenging the report of the Forest Department relating to the reports of the Sawant and Karapurkar committees was transferred to the National Green Tribunal in 2013 In 2016 the NGT directed the Goa government to appoint another committee to examine the controversial forest areas Government of Goa eventually appointed Ms Deepshikha Sharma an IFS officer with the Forest Department in its Working Plan division to review the work of the Sawant and Karapurkar committees The Sharma committee would also examine the work of the Forest Department then file a report This the Sharma Committee completed and submitted to the Goa government on 2162019 Shortly thereafter the Forest Minister rejected the Sharma report Goa government promises a new review committee It soon set up one

a fresh writ petition filed by the Goa Foundation which demanded the takeover of all leased areas as the terms of all mining leases had ended issued an order to 88 leaseholders asking them to surrender these areas under the provisions of Rule 121hh of the Mineral Concession Rules 2016 A huge number of writ petitions were filed in the Bombay High Court challenging the order This time both the Goa Government and the Goa Foundation presented mutually supportive arguments to defeat the petitions On 7102022 the Bombay High Court dismissed all the petitions The first couple of appeals against the judgment 7102022 were rejected by the Supreme Court of India by a brief order on 21112022 thus bringing the final curtain down on the century old privately controlled mining industry

Foundation took a decision to file a corruption complaint against the three government officials responsible for granting them These included the then Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsenkar Pawan Kumar Sains Secretary Mines and Mr Prasanna Acharya Director of Mines Geology After a year of investigations the Honble Lokayuktha admitted the complaint and filed a detailed report to the Goa government The report recommended registration of an FIR and investigation by the CBI and removal of the officers concerned as they were persons unfit to hold public office 1 Complaint of the Goa Foundation

dated 17042020 4 Special report of the Honble Lokayukta to the Goa Governor dated 27052020 The Supreme Court of India and Intergenerational Equity The Goa Mining Case This new book on the historic Goa mining case is written by Claude Alvares and Rahul Basu It chronicles the amazing story of how a small publicly funded environmental monitoring group called the Goa Foundation successfully fought a ten year battle to bring Goas entire privately held mining industry to account The Foundations legal initiatives and petitions led to the closure of the nearly 100year old mining industry Except for a brief 2 year interlude mining in Goa has remained shut for more than ten years At the time of closure more than half of Indias mineral ore exports originated from Goa Indias smallest state The Goa mining case led to three consecutive judgments of the Supreme Court with the Court each time refusing any concessions to former lease holders These judgments also led to wideranging changes in mining laws and regulations including the requirement that all future alienation of minerals would only be done through the process of public auction thus generating maximum revenues to public exchequers The case also heralded the beginnings of the first judicially instigated Permanent Fund for the State of Goa which would receive monies from every sale invoice dealing with minerals and sequester them for the benefit and use of future generations of Goans The Supreme Court of India and Intergenerational Equity will be useful to all persons especially social activists keenly interested in regulation of the extractives industry issues of ownership of natural resources the manner of their alienation and the apex courts cumulative and consistent judgments furthering the implementation of the principle of intergenerational equity The book contains a daytoday record of the court proceedings arguments on behalf of the Goa Foundation led by Prashant Bhushan the counter arguments of more than a dozen legal luminaries from Rohtagi to KK Venugopal The authors have also included the full text of the unprecedented judgment that declared five years of mining illegal as it was carried out with a valid lease A final section gathers together current legal thinking surrounding alienation of natural resources the need for permanent funds to protect the interests of coming generations and the Supreme Courts various judgments on intergenerational equity and the doctrine of Public Trust Order the book online from httpswwwbanyantreebookstorecom You can also find it at Broadway Book Centre and Varsha

        "content": "Information Donate Contact Home Anti Plastic Campaign Anti Plastic Campaign The proliferation of plastic wastes in the urban and village environments of Goa and the abysmally hopeless and inadequate arrangements of municipalities and panchayat authorities for the disposal of this plastic litter are subjects which many environment NGOs and citizens have expressed anguish over right from the inception of the Goa Environment Federation GEF At the first GEF meeting in June 1998 the problem of plastic waste disposal was highlighted as a major environmental problem facing Goa by no less than five NGOs as well as several citizens in written submissions made before the Goa Environment Commission constituted by the GEF Thereafter at every subsequent meeting the issue came up for discussion NGOs like Nirmal Vishwawhich have worked on the problem of plastic waste disposal for the past couple of yearsexplained the difficulties they faced in disposing of plastic wastes after they had organised collection drives in Ponda taluka These drivesorganised through schools and other educational institutionsreceived the cooperation of the public but had not deterred the use of disposable plastic by the same citizens Furthermore the problem of what to do with the plastic garbage once collected remained unsolved When the GEF came to know that the Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court had taken up the problem of garbage disposal in the state of Goa in a suo moto writ petition GEF thought it fit to actively support the courts initiative Four organisations filed intervenor applications Nirmal Vishwa Ponda Peoples Movement for Civic Action Panjim Goa Foundation Mapusa and Margao First Margao A perusal of the affidavits filed by the municipalities and panchayats in the court proceedings revealed that none of these institutions had any schemes to deal with this problem Neither had the government made any arrangements to take care of the collection and disposal of the increasing quantities of nonbiodegradable garbage generated in the towns and villages of Goa Through the court proceedings the government was forced to consider the problem of plastic waste disposal as a separate category from general garbage GEF brought to the notice of the Court that there were in fact two statutes directly relevant to the problem of plastic garbage disposal The Goa NonBiodegradable Garbage Disposal Act 1996 which had come into force on 1st January 1998 and the Plastics Recycled Manufacture and Usage Rules 1999 issued by the Ministry of Environment Forests under the Environment Protection Act 1986 Although the Goa Act was in force from 1998 hardly any steps had been taken by the authorities to set up the mandatory garbage management committees which would study the local situation prepare suitable action plans and ensure their implementation As far as the Plastics Rules 1999 were concerned nothing whatsoever had been done for their implementation by the State In fact the authorities responsible for their implementation namely the State Pollution Control Board and the District Collectors remained unaware of their vital role in the enforcement of the said Rules It was during these proceedings that the State Government informed the Court that it had notified on 712000 a Committee to look into all aspects of solid waste management in the state of Goa including the relevant laws and to produce a comprehensive report within three months outlining a scheme of action and various measures to be taken by the different authorities to deal with the problem Peoples Movement for Civic Action was the NGO representative named on the Committee Regular meetings of the Committee during the next three months resulted in the finalisation of a report titled Solid Waste Management in the State of Goa SWM Report which was presented to the Court in April 2000 In July the State Government informed the court that it had accepted the report and would immediately commence steps for its implementation As a first step the State Government took a decision to enforce the ban on use of plastic bags below 20 microns from August 15 2000 The government sought time till 31st December to complete the steps necessary for full implementation of other aspects of the SWM Report which included a ban on the use of recycled plastic bags for food items setting up of composting units to take care of biodegradable garbage arranging for the disposal of nonbiodegradable garbage to recycling plants outside the state ensuring that Garbage Management Committees are set up in all panchayats and municipalities Taking a cue from the SWM Report and also with a view to strengthen the efforts of the government GEF decided at its meeting held in Ponda in the midJuly to launch a plastic clean up programme for the entire state of Goa It was unanimously felt that the year 2001 the dawn of the new millennium should find public places in Goa free from plastic litter which presently not only disfigures market places tourists spots beaches roads parks gardens but also litters the countryside choking drains and nallahs wherever the plastic accumulates Through this campaign GEF hoped to highlight the problem of plastic waste so that both the government and the citizens become aware of its magnitude At the same time GEF wished to demonstrate its concern by working with the authorities to find ecologically acceptable solutions Search 2025 Copyright Goa Foundation Powered by WordPress HTML5 Blank"

        "content": "Information Donate Contact Home Biodiversity in Goa Biodiversity in Goa 10 Introduction The term biodiversity is used to describe the huge variety of life on this planet An astonishing 18 million different species have been identified and named by tribals peasants and scientists Yet we still do not really know how many diverse species there are in the world We know that there are about 8600 species of birds 4000 species of mammals and 32000 species of flowering plants because these organisms are relatively well studied However there is still uncertainty about other organisms such as insects where estimates vary from eight million to a hundred million fungi where 70000 have been identified but 16 million are thought to exist and littlestudied organisms such as bacteria nematode worms and mites There are at least eight million species on our planet and probably a lot more so those who identify name and classify organisms still have a lot of work to do One of the greatest challenges for the new millenium is to increase our knowledge of the organisms with which we share this planet There are three aspects of biodiversity The variety of habitats environments in which living organisms live The number of species The variation within each species 11 Why preserve biodiversity This diversity holds together life on Earth The green plants on land and microscopic plants in the oceans produce the oxygen we breathe Global climate change would be far worse if it were not for the role of forests and oceans in absorbing much of the carbon dioxide we are putting into the atmosphere Mangrove forests hold tropical coastlines together Each individual species depends upon others for its existence and the links between different species hold life together If one species is removed then the others that depend upon it will also either die or be seriously affected Some species are particularly important because without them their whole ecosystem will collapse For example forest trees and ocean plankton which control our climate are often little valued by people but their role in controlling our environment is the single most important aspect of biodiversity A second reason for protecting biodiversity is because human beings are dependent upon it We depend on biodiversity for our food medicines shelter for many industrial products such as wood and rubber cosmetics and many other products As we lose species we are also losing potential new medicines and foods that may be needed to continue human life on Earth For example over half of our medicines come originally from plants and new ones are still being discovered A recent example is the anticancer drug taxol from the bark of the Pacific yew tree A third reason for preserving biodiversity is ethical Is it right for people to destroy so much of Natures creation Fourthly we should preserve biodiversity purely for beauty and enjoyment It would be a dull world without the flowers and songbirds around us or the whales in the sea or the magnificent animals in the sanctuaries and national parks 12 Brief background to the SAP The subject of this report is the status conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the state of Goa one of the smallest states of the Indian Union Goa presents an astonishing diversity of endemic species habitats and ecosystems For historical reasons the region remained relatively undeveloped till fairly recently and therefore appears to have suffered less from the grosser forms of environmental damage almost routinely associated with development elsewhere But with 40 years of development now behind it the impact of intensified economic activities on biodiversity in this region is visibly noticeable and worrying Concern with biodiversity has crystallized worldwide with the adoption of what is known as the Biodiversity Convention Tragically the growing awareness of its significance for the survival of all living beings on the planet is coinciding with a very real and threatening reduction in biodiversity indices across the world Biodiversity at its simplest means the diversity of all living beings in the world All over the world neglect of biodiversity concerns has led to situations in which the astonishing variety of life is being permanently and adversely compromised The impetus for this work on the biodiversity of Goa came from the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan NBSAP One of the heartening features of the NBSAP has been its serious effort not to remain at the level of a government exercise In fact in Goa NGOs individual scientists and professionals individually committed to biodiversity conservation have provided critical direction to the process with the cooperation of government departments The Goa Foundation an environmental NGO and the Forest Department Government of Goa were the nodal agencies for the preparation and implementation of the Goa Strategy and Action Plan SAP As part of the process a number of individuals not affiliated formally with NGOs or formal researchteaching institutions were also encouraged to play an active part in the process 13 Scope of the SAP The scope of the Goa State BSAP was expanded to assess the status of biodiversity from a number of different levels and a variety of perspectives Biomes Ecosystems and Habitats Goa is under the influence of two global biomes the marine biome of the Arabian sea and the terrestrial forest biome of the Western Ghats Within this geographical canvas are a wide range of ecosystems and habitats eg forests ghats alluvial plains coasts rivers estuaries mangroves wetlands etc The ecophysiology of the habitats is governed by complex ecological and metereological conditions There are normal habitats and extreme habitats like the rock pools and the salt pans There are microhabitats which are equally important eg the termite mounds which play a significant role in the decomposition of plant litter The status of biodiversity in each of these habitats varies depending naturally on a variety of genetic and environmental factors Each habitat faces its own peculiar mix of pressures on its biodiversity and consequently different strategies for conservation are called for A proper understanding of these habitats and ecosystems is therefore essential for the conservation of their biodiversity Species and varieties Although incomplete an exhaustive listing of species has been done from the available published and unpublished sources see Annexure 6 Agro ecosystems There has been specific focus on the biodiversity of agricultural ecosystems We have studied the centuriesold system of the khazans puran sheti and other traditional methods of farming fishing practices etc Within this area we have tried to highlight issues relating to cultivars or varieties of various agricultural crops Ecotheology This report also examines those practices and beliefs relating to nature which have an impact on biodiversity and its sustainable use The process of preparation of the action plan was based on an intensive study of indigenous knowledge and whether such use of biodiversity was in itself sustainable Impacts of Human Activities on Biodiversity We support development However we found we could question the necessity for continuing with the present form of development which necessarily requires the destruction of biodiversity or is based on its unsustainable exploitation Hence we thought it necessary to catalogue all those processes and forces associated with development agendas that threatened or destroyed biodiversity in new unforeseen and thoughtless ways in the State 14 Objectives The principal objectives of the Goa State BSAP are To document assess and review the present status of the biodiversity of Goa at ecosystem and species level To understand document and popularise timetested sustainable natural resource management practices and the rich ecotheological traditions of the people of this region To study the causes for the decline of traditional knowledge and to evolve mechanisms to reverse this trend with the aid of the community and to protect strengthen and disseminate this knowledge To study the impact of human activity and development generally on biodiversity To understand the causes of biodiversity degradation identify the hotspots of biodiversity erosion and to work out ways to combat these To prioritise the choice of ecosystems species and habitats for directing conservation efforts and to lobby for the maintenance of gene pools in labs and in fields To study the legal and administrative framework governing biodiversity and suggest methods for strengthening it To work out implementable mechanisms for conserving the biodiversity of Goa with active participation of all stakeholders including the public NGOs government etc so as to mitigate the worst kind of excesses meted out to biodiversity in the past 40 years Increase the awareness of the importance of biodiversity and disseminate the knowledge regarding the same among the public at large To encourage new initiatives in biodiversity research and promote scientific research for full cataloguing of the biodiversity of the state ensure its sustainable utilisation and to protect the biointellectual property rights of the local communities 15 Guiding Principles The principles which have guided the work on the Goa State BSAP are A healthy respect for traditional knowledge including oral regarding the sustainable uses of biodiversity and the need for its protection and revival Vulnerable groups and women within such groups are invariably more dependent on biodiversity and they are therefore to be considered its most crucial stakeholders The work should be carried out in the local vernacular language in which the common people speak The work should be carried out as a result of a participatory process with widespread involvement of people Also the effort should be to examine these issues in a nonanthropocentric fashion and see them as well from below The SAP should never degenerate into a pure academic exercise It should fairly reflect the views of all actors and it should discuss the allimportant political realities It should frankly address issues relating to equitable access to biodiversity 16 Methodology An attempt was made to make the process of preparation of the Goa SAP as democratic and participatory as possible Also specific thrust was given to not keeping work on the project confined to the professional academic and research community but to generate material from within the communities themselves In fact some of the subreports have been prepared either in Konkani or in Marathi and are based on active contributions from the communities themselves The fairly large amount of material already available in English was also used during the work The work on the Goa SAP began through a process of consultation involving NGOs research and academic institutions government and individuals knowledgeble about biodiversity in their areas On the basis of this preliminary consultation a Steering Committee SC was formed Annexure 1 The SC first met on 8th December 2000 and four times thereafter Annexure 2 During the first meeting major issues and geographical areas to be covered were considered and decided Before the second meeting the SC was expanded and specific areas of work were allotted to the members Around this time a press conference was also held and detailed articles on the Goa SAP appeared in all local newspapers Annexure 3 People who expressed interest at this stage were also included in the SC subject to their willingness to take up specific assignments It is the primary consultations done through this process that have been the most important aspects of this project in Goa They form the base upon which this report rests Detailed research on specific aspects or topics was carried out based on the geographical and thematic divisions decided upon in the SC Researchers fanned out in Goas villages and met people for whom biodiversity is of vital importance in their own domains in remote areas Eventually over 500 persons in different villages were accosted and they spoke on various aspects of biodiversity to the members of the team Annexure 4 Members of the SC who had been given specific assignments then completed their work under the overall guidance and supervision of Dr Nandkumar Kamat During meetings of the SC progress was reviewed and suggestions made The members interacted with the supervisor on a regular basis In May 2001 a oneday workshop was convened to consider the work done till date to identify gaps and to work out the framework of the draft SAP Annexure 5 Based on this some preliminary drafting was done Feedback from members of the public which came in was incorporated Dr Nandkumar Kamat guided most of the work up to this stage Much of the information collected by the various members of the SC as part of the process has never been documented before in a scientific and organized manner The following biodiversity reports which were novel initiatives for Goa were prepared under the supervision of Dr Nandkumar Kamat Bibliography of materials relating to Goas Biodiversity Dr Kasturi N Desai prepared a checklist of Goas biodiversity Table 1 This checklist covered species of plants and animals recorded so far in Goa from published and unpublished literature The checklist also listed various habitats The individual species data was then verified against available field reports where available generated by scientists For example the plants list was finalised under the supervision of M Janarthanam a plant taxonomist from Goa University and the revised lists have been included in this report in Annexure 6 List of medical plants can be found at Annexure 7 Table 1 Goas biodiversity at a glance Taxa Catalogued No Remarks FLORA I

Available Sacred groves and water resources Rajendra P Kerkar prepared a report on the sacred groves based on primary information and the rivers of mostly north Goa district This is part of a larger project of documenting all the sacred groves in Goa on which work is proceeding The research uncovered the vital role of traditional beliefs and practices and the underlying conservation principles that had led to the protection of these forested stretches It also evaluates the status of such groves which of them are still intact and which have been subjected to disturbance and why The list of sacred grooves is provided at Annexure 8 Traditional natural resource management ethno technology and community based plant germ plasm conservation Mahendra Phaldessai and Vaijayanti Prabhugaonkar worked in the three southern talukas of Goa Canacona Quepem and Sanguem They generated primary information o traditional occupations wild crop seeds biodiversity and traditional nature conservation principles in this area Their report in Marathi gives a picture of biodiversitybased traditional practices EthnoIcthyology Dr Manoj R Borkar documented the community knowledge of lesserknown fauna in Mormugao and Salcette talukas with emphasis on marine species based on primary data The work went beyond this towards identifying biodiversity conservation related threats and opportunites and has also thrown up valuable insights regarding strategies that could be employed for conservation Traditional knowledge of Biodiversity and sociolinguistics aspects of resource knowledge Dr Bernadette Gomes collected primary information on biodiversity and resource use in the areas of Salcette Quepem and Sanguem She documented practical uses of littleknown biodiversity by communites in these three talukas with special focus on marginal groups and women Traditional knowledge of Biodiversity ethnotechnology and resource geography Prakash Paryenkar generated primary information on biodiversity traditional knowledge and traditional occupations in Sattari and Sanguem talukas His work in Konkani has shed valuable light on littleknown traditional knowledge concepts and occupations particularly in the areas of agricultural systems Ethnoherpetology Nirmal Kulkarni prepared a report on humananimal and humanreptile relationships in Sattari taluka He has also stressed the importance of environmental education and suggested simple programmes which could be easily implemented Bhalchandra Mayenkar recorded the reptile diversity and ecological aspects from the areas left uncovered by Nirmal Kulkarni Avifauna Harvey DSouza catalogued the diversity of birds and their behaviour and identified the habitats of migratory birds as well as the pressures on wetlands from primary experience Besides the overall supervision of the preparation of the above reports Dr Nandkumar Kamat compiled the basic categorisation of some of the different ecosystems the specifics of the agroecosystem known as the khazan and prepared the tables listing threat perceptions and neglected habitats The following significant aspects of biodiversity in Goa and unique to the State have been culled from the various reports listed above Fifteen villages in Goa are named after the mango tree two after the kokum There are villages named after the Banyan the Tamarind and the Tulsi Annexure 9 Ten villages are named after the tiger three after peacocks five after snakes Villages are named after anthills forest land gardens waterfalls and water bodies Annexure 9 The replacement of forest and natural vegetation by large plantations especially cashew has eliminated wildlife habitats in several areas The population of monitor lizards has declined because there is no control exercised over the use of their skins for making drums ghumot After several decades Olive Ridley Turtles have returned to nest on several Goan beaches after a successful conservation programme initiated by NGOs local village communities and the Forest Department Puran Sheti is a form of agriculture unique to Goa in which fields are created on the banks of river beds which have run dry Such fields disappear with the onset of the monsoon Wildlife worship in Goa includes the worship of crocodiles mangge thapnee and termite mounds Celebrations of Ganesh Mahotsav in Goa has a unique feature of Matoli a display of seasonal fruits and vegetables hung over the idol Among butterflies the biggest Common Birdwing and the smallest Grass Jewel are to be found in Goa 52 of the forest area of Goa falls under Wildlife Sanctuary notifications 84 of existing forests in Goa belong to the Government Iron ore contaminated sediments from mining areas have formed a film in the estuarine areas and destroyed the ecology of clam beds The Wroughtons Free Tailed Bat endemic Chiropteran species found only in this area would become extinct if a Karnataka Government proposal to divert water from the Madei river is allowed Certain wild mushroom species are in danger of extinction due to indiscriminate commercial exploitation Frogs are illegally served in some Goan restaurants under the nomenclature of jumping chicken Kumeri slashandburn agriculture has been finally stopped in Goa and officially no longer exists Ganv Bhovni village based hunting of wild life for ritual purposes continues in a few areas despite being in violation of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 Interestingly Goas marine resources are also being shared by immigrants from the neighbouring states An interesting case is that of the Pachangrais a nomadic fishing tribe of Mysore district in Karnataka who seasonally migrate into Goa for fishing activities However these are not viewed as a threat by the local fishermen as the species which they catch are not desired by the locals The State plays host to 55 sacred groves preserved and maintained because of their association with various deities Neither the Regional Plan of Goa 2001 nor the draft Regional Plan for Goa 2010 which purport to control land use in the State make any reference to biodiversity There are a large number of agrosystems designed by local people to suit different ecological nichesneeds each with its own local name In the coastal areas satellite pictures indicate that while the vegetative cover has increased the number of species used largely by resorts etc show a steady decrease Large development projects like the Selaulim and Anjunem dams were constructed without an EIA and without considering impacts on the biodiversity of the areas in which they are located Besides the commissioning of the above reports and field investigations and studies various other measures to elicit public participation were also resorted to by the SC The Call for Participation was distributed in English and Konkani at meetings organised by the WWF Goa University etc No public hearings were however held Dr Manoj Borkar a Member of the SC attended a Midterm Review Meeting cum Workshop at INSA auditorium at New Delhi in June 2001 and presented a consolidated status report on the work of the Goa State BSAP Dr Kasturi Desai represented the Goa SC at the Western Region NBSAP meeting at Ahmedabad in November 2001 They were able to provide valuable feedback to the SC to help align the work with the overall national perspective Dr Nandakumar Kamat presented the summary of the Goa BSAP work at a workshop organised by the CEE on January 15th 2002 at Donapaula Goa to discuss Rio10 issues exclusively for the Western region In October 2001 the Goa State Steering Committee organised a workshop on Coastal Biodiversity in association with the WestCoast EcoRegion Group This oneday meeting was well attended both by persons from Goa and resource persons from the TPCG who gave valuable feedback on the whole process Annexure 10 A draft report was prepared in March 2002 Thereafter the report was drafted and circulated to independent scientists for checking of the species inventories Corrections and modifications were incorporated in the month of MarchApril 2002 Thereafter the Draft Final Report was printed and circulated officially to all Government departments NGOs and experts for final reading and comments The Report was discussed and adopted formally at a meeting of all stakeholders held in June 2002 subject to the observations and criticisms made at the meeting As it was felt that the conservation strategy aspect needed to be strengthened a further meeting of people was called specifically with this in mind in July 2002 The immediate action plan envisages taking the information presented in this report in the form of a mobile exhibition to different villages and towns of Goa not only to enhance awareness but to solicit public cooperation at all levels in the biodiversity conservation programme Also proposed is a major food mela which will be based on promoting foods made from local biological resources including wild foods and using indigenous or traditional recipes 20 Profile of area 21 Geographical Profile Size Location Latitudes Longitudes etc Goa is situated along the Central west coast of India lying in between latitudes 150 48 00 and 140 43 54 and longitudes 740 20 13 to 730 40 33E The altitude ranges from sea level to more than 600 mts above sea level in the Western Ghats The State comprises 11 talukas out of which Tiswadi Bardez Pernem Bicholim Satari and Ponda talukas comprise North Goa district 1736 sq km and Mormugao Salcette Canacona and Quepem make up South Goa district 1966 sq km North to South the length of Goa State is 105 km from North to South and 60 km from east to west The geographical area of Goa State is 3702 sq km Geology The principal geological feature of the land is the extensive laterization which occurs because of Goas tropical moist climate subject to vast seasonal changes The laterite caps are extensive over most of the terrain mountains plateaus or plains and they have by and large determined the nature of the regions vegetative cover Specifically the State is predominantly covered by the rocks of the Goa Group belonging to the Dharwar subgroup of the Archean to proterozic age except for a narrow strip along the northeastern corner occupied by the Deccan traps The Goa group consists of green schistic faces of metamorphic rocks which have been folded and intruded by granite gneiss feldspar gneiss hornblende granite and porphyritic granite followed by basic intrusives The rocks of the Goa group are broadly comparable and correlated with the rocks included in the Chitradurga group of Dharwar Super Group of Karnataka During subrecent to recent times the rocks have been subjected to laterisation resulting in a cover of laterite of varying thickness The soils of the state belong to 4 orders 6 sub orders 10 great groups 14 subgroups 21 families and 32 series Inceptisols are dominant followed by entisols ultisols and alfisols Watershed The country has been divided into several watersheds which are reflected in the Watershed Atlas of India see map Goa falls in the 5th Water source region of the B Cauvery basin of the first catchment Sharavati to Savitri and B subcatchment Kalinadi to Vaghotan This area has been classified into 6 watersheds and given the classification Nos 5B1B1 5B1B2 5B1B3 5B1B4 5B1B5 and 5B1B6 These 6 watersheds then further subdivide into 67 subwatersheds which are themselves further subdivided into 139 mini watersheds approx area of 1030 sqkm and 374 micro watersheds approx area of 510 sqkm Source Goa State Remote Sensing Centre Department of Science Technology and Environment River Systems The region is drained by nine independent rivers flowing generally from East Western Ghats to West the Arabian Sea An exception is the Sal river in south Goa which follows a northeast to south west course due to the west coast fault Terekhol Mandovi Zuari Colvale Sal Talpona Saleri Canacona and Galgibag are the main nine rivers of Goa Due to the extent of their drainage areas and the human attraction they hold these main nine rivers and their 42 tributaries play a significant role in the lives of the people of the State Between themselves the Mandovi and Zuari together drain 2553 sq km about 70 of the total geographical area of Goa These rivers are a major source of potable water The surface water system is intimately linked up with their development since they provide irrigation facilities for agriculture produce biotic and mineral resources help in the bargebased transport of ore from the mining areas to the port and ferry people and goods to different parts of the state Goas rivers are unique in that they are both tidal and rainfed Huge volumes of monsoon water fall within the watershed areas and are then drained out through the major rivers to the sea But all the rivers are subject to tidal influence to a great distance inwards from their mouth In some case the ebb and flow of the tides reach 40 kms inland The salinity factor in the river varies sharply between the monsoon and nonmonsoon periods and so does the quality of water in wells all along the banks which tends to get increasingly saline as the summer months advance The rivers discharge their water into the Arabian Sea at several points completing the hydrological cycle 22 SocioEconomic Profile In terms of official or conventionally perceived socioeconomic indicators Goa does fairly well compared to many other Indian states The per capita income of Goa is the highest in the country This is due partly to better compliance and reporting but the general prosperity is undeniable if one does not move out of the highly developed coastal belt After a period of high population growth the previous decade 19912001 witnessed a decadal growth rate of 1489 However statistics conceal more than they reveal There is serious enough unemployment and poverty in the State In terms of other socioeconomic indicators as well Goas performance is rated good Literacy levels are over 80 overall though for women the rate is about 75 In terms of health and infrastructure indicators also Goa performs substantially well SocioEconomic Indicators in Brief Population 2001 Census Total 1343998 1343 lakh persons Proportion 658381 658 lakhs females 685617 males Sex Ratio 960 Declined from 967 in 1991 Decadal Growth Rate

Scheduled Castes comprise just over 2 of the total population The population of Scheduled Tribes is negligible but communities like Kunbis Gawdas Velips and Dhangars widely considered Goas original tribes and estimated at 30 of population are not included in this category Goa is today a highly urbanised state in India This makes it a special case for conservation because haphazard and unsustainable urbanisation over past 50 years has drastically impacted natural ecosystems and biodiversity Education Literacy 2001 Census 8232 8888 for males 7551 for females Primary Schools 199900

freedom struggle for liberation from Portuguese rule challenged the legitimacy of the Portuguese as longstanding rulers The Indian Army marched into Goa against little resistance on December 19 1961 Thereafter Parliament amended the Constitution in early 1962 and Goa together with Daman and Diu the other Portuguese enclaves became a centrally administered Union Territory of India A Lieutenant Governor was sworn in and an informal Consultative Council of 29 members was constituted on September 24 1962 It advised the Union Government till the first popular elections were held in 1964 Thereafter Goa Daman and Diu had a common legislative assembly of 30 members headed by a Chief Minister The highlights of the ensuing years were the first panchayat elections the ascendency of the MGP to power the formation of the Land Reforms Commission the passing of the Goa Agricultural Tenancy Act 1964 and the Land Revenue Code 1968 an historic Opinion Poll in 1967 in which Goans voted against merger with neighbouring Maharashtra the agitation by the traditional fishermen students the fall of MGP and ascendency of Congress passing of the Tree Protection Act and establishment of Goa university in 1985 and an unprecedented massive sustained movement from 1984 which culminated in 1987 in official language status being conferred on Konkani and colanguage nonofficial status for Marathi The Panchayat was the first democratic entity created in Goa soon after independence The administration was run through Block Development Committees which were a sort of bridge between the Panchayat and the Government The scenario changed on May 30 1987 when Goa became the 25th fullfledged State of the Indian Union Since the elections in 1989 the State has had a 40member assembly with full legislative powers The most noticeable feature of poststatehood has been chronic political instability During the 25 years between 1964 and 1989 Goa had just three chief ministers After the 1989 elections there have been no less than thirteen in the space of eleven years some with terms lasting as little as a few months and one surviving for just four days This has had serious negative consequences on the economy and ecology of the State After the 73rd and 74th Constitution amendments were adopted by Parliament in 1992 Goa was required to have a threetiered political setup with decentralisation of political powers to local authorities Government enacted the Goa Panchayati Raj Act in 1993 to enable panchayats to have exclusive jurisdiction over several local issues It also amended the Goa Municipalities Act 1968 to bring that Act in line with the Constitutions requirements The middle tier comprising of Zilla Parishads has only just come into existence In the older dispensation there were 374 revenue villages divided into 183 village panchayats in turn organized under 10 development blocks The administration was run through the Collector at the district level the Mamlatadar at the taluka level and Sarpanch at the panchayat level There were also 13 municipal towns administered by Municipal Councils and Chief Officers now 11 The Municipal Councils came under the Director of Municipal Administration in Panaji Though legally the Panchayats and Councils have new enlarged and sweeping powers and separate jurisdiction after the Constitutional amendments they continue to operate mentally under the old dispensation The major political parties today are the CongressI and the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP But many MLAs are members of their parties only in name and will ditch their party whenever they are promised power by a rival group In the older dispensation there were 374 revenue villages divided into 183 village panchayats in turn divided into 10 development blocks The administration was run through the Collector at the district level the Mamlatadar at the taluka level and Sarpanch at the panchayat level There are also 13 municipal towns administered by Municipal Councils and Chief Officers The Municipal Councils came under the Director of Municipal Administration in Panaji Though legally the Panchayats and Councils have new enlarged and sweeping powers and separate jurisdiction after the Constitutional amendments they continue to operate mentally under the old dispensation Traditional Methods of Governance Comunidades One unique feature of Goa is its still existing system of the Comunidades which does not exist in any other part of the country Many political dynasties have ruled Goa since the Mauryan period but it was the continuity of the selfgoverned village institutions called the village gaunkaris which survived the political religious social and ecological turmoils The term Gaunkari has been derived from Ganv village The essence of a Ganv was in gaunvpon sense of belonging to the village The Portuguese replaced these terms with comunidades meaning village communities The comunidades were actually the custodians of Goas natural resources and biodiversity for more than 3000 years The institution of the comunidade which had much to commend it is nowadays in a state of irreversible decline and hence offers only passing historical interest though it may also give some indications as to how natural resources could be sustainably managed at the level of the community There are at present 226 comunidades in Goa spread over its eleven talukas While they own only 14 of the cultivable land in this territory they are significant as far as paddy cultivation is concerned According to available statistics in three talukas of Ilhas Salcette and Bardez having the largest paddy area the comunidades hold over 55 of land Ilhas 55 Salcette 51 and Bardez 56 In Marmagao taluka where the total paddy area available is 1019 ha the comunidades have 62 land The comunidades were actually the custodians of Goas natural resources and biodiversity for more than 3000 years The institution which had much to commend it is nowadays in a state of irreversible decline and hence offers only passing historical interest though it may also give some indications as to how natural resources could be sustainably managed at the level of the community 24 Ecological Profile During its relative isolation when under Portuguese rule from the rest of the country Goa was by the standards of most other imperial powers benignly governed A Portuguese empire in its decline did not place too many demands on the States natural resources but considerable damage was nevertheless caused The Portuguese for example paralysed the Comunidades with adverse effects on local control over the environment They introduced vast monocultures of an exotic species like cashew Cashew plantations have very poor biodiversity The Portuguese also gave liberal and rampant mining concessions and leases to the private investorsprospectors These concessions became the foundation of Goas privately owned mining industry which till today follows no environment laws Thus the Portuguese are responsible for the destruction of forests and vegetation in the areas leased out before 1961 The Portuguese also ignored land reforms and created the system of morgados refered to and criticized by Franciso Louis Gommes in the 19th century The Portuguese also imported alongwith many economically useful exotic plant species plant and animal pathogens weeds etc Liberated from Portuguese rule in 1961 Goa has been induced to rapidly become a part of the national mainstream while struggling to retain in some measure its unique charm as one of the most attractive bioregions of the country Broadly speaking there are three main physical divisions or ecozones the mountainous region of the Sahyadris in the east the middle level plateaus in the centre and the lowlying river basins and the coastal plains Of these naturally the least known is the Western Ghat region which runs from north to south but in the hinterland The most visible or wellknown part is the coastal belt which runs as a strip from north to south Sandwiched in between is the midland region apparently nondescript but nevertheless with its own significant ecological and cultural characteristics and the focus of much of the States industrial development The Western Ghats are one of the richest reservoirs of biodiversity in the world The sections that lie within Goa the Sahyadris and which dominate its ecosystems readily reflect this bewildering complexity in plant animal and bird life Official recognition of the ecological value of this area has come in the form of gazette notifications declaring huge areas as sanctuaries or biosphere reserves In the year 2001 a confederation of environmental NGOs from Goa Karnataka and Maharashtra proposed the creation of a new ground reality the Sahyadri Ecologically Sensative Area or SESA to be notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests under the provisions of the Environment Protection Act 1986 The second ecozone the central strip consists by and large of plateaus at varying levels not exceeding about 100 metres and not less than 30 metres in height While apparently nondescript this midland portion nevertheless has significant ecological and cultural characteristics often in sharp contrast to coastal Goa The plateaus are a characteristic feature of Goa the tops are fairly level but in many areas deeply notched by gullies The plateau rims are noticeably sharp A scarp slope usually marks the quick transition to the alluvial plain below Wherever the plateaus meet the coastline they end in headlands in the north of Goa the Aguada the Cabo and Mormugao heights are good examples of this Not unnaturally the historic forts of Goas defence were all strategically situated on such headlands Today they lie largely in ruins The vegetation topping the plateaus and their laterite cover is comprised mainly of various species of scrub and rough grass due to the very poor shallow soil There is more intense vegetation both natural and cultivated along the scarp faces and in the hollows of the gullies This includes good strands of typical monsoon forest The gullies have numerous springs which feed the rivers down below As the Gazetteer of Goa describes it The laterite plateau with clumps of grass and thinly spread cashew shrubs often with a church or a cross perched skirted by greenery of coconut palms and natural growth deeply entrenched notches of low grounds with betel and coconut gardens the kulagars and the plateau base sharply merging into the alluvial flats below form a recurrent theme in the landscape of most of central and coastal Goa The more prominent of the group are the plateau lands of Pernem Mopa Morgim Assonora North Ponda and Cundaim and Betul Sanvordem and Quepem South Associated towns include Assonora Bicholim Ponda and Quepem The plateaus like Verna Kundaim Marcaim PilerneSaligao were converted into industrial estates whereas dense settlements have come up at Porvorim BambolimDonapaula plateaus The plateaus display a large biodiversity of plants especailly grasses shrubs herbs insects amphibians reptiles and birds and are known for many species of wildflowers This part of Goa contrasts with coastal Goa in more ways than one While the coastlands carry a Westernised landscape this is a region of Hindu iconographies expressed in numerous shrines and temples the most important of which are the shrines of Mangueshi and Shantadurga The third distinct ecological component of the Goa bioregionafter the Western Ghat area and the lateritic plateauscomprises the alluvial lowlands and coasts The former comprise the stretches of rivers which have over the centuries received the eroded material from the higher levels of the Sahyadris The two major riverine plains are those of the Mandovi and the Zuari rivers which between themselves comprise the major alluvial deposits The Chapora in the North and the Kushavati and Sal river valleys are the locations of the other major riverine plains in Goa However such alluvial plains and valleys can be found in between the plateau regions as well All these alluvial valleys are areas of rich cultivation with settlements of agricultural populations The entire area comprises a distinct ecological zone of the State It comprises the main paddygrowing areas including the khazans but excludes the cashew growing areas which are generally found in the higher tracts Besides paddy the other principal crop is coconut Both rice and coconut together with the fish harvested from the seas and rivers are essential to the idea of Goa as it has evolved over the centuries Only the proper and adequate availability of all three elements can continue to bring mental and spiritual peace to the local population Besides these rivers there are numerous wetlands a few of them manmade but the rest largely natural Many of these wetlands are the habitats of a large variety of birds Some of them are used for purposes of irrigation The most important of these are the wetlands of Chandor RaitolemCurtorim Panchwadi Carambolim Chimbel Mayem Kakora and Calafur From the coastline if you leave aside a narrow 80 m stretch from the sea the entire lowlands strip varying in width from 12 to 15 km is the most developed part of the State containing about 80 of the population This area is densely urbanized While the Western Ghat area is now a completely protected zone this is not the case with the coastal region which till 1991 continued to remain the frenzied focus of every new development from five star resorts to aquaculture farms The Coastal Regulation Zone notification now protects the area from the High Tide Line upto 500 metres Within these three ecozones lie a myriad of natural and agro ecosystems each exhibiting its own unique biodiversity 25 Brief History Footprints of prehistoric humans in Goa have been dated to 100 millennia before the present The migration took place from the valleys of Ghatprabha and Malaprabha and the first human camps were established in the paleolithic age by homo sapiens A very interesting finding has been the discovery of rich rock art in Goa in 1993 This rock art gives insights into the state of the ecosystem and biodiversity in prehistoric times There can be little doubt that Goa was among the most important entrepots of the ancient and medieval world The index of its stature was the internationally acceptable gold currency in use around the 10th century embossed with the regal leonine crest of the ruling Kadambas and their patron deity Saptakoteshwara When the Portuguese arrived five centuries later Goa was under Muslim rule The city and port had shifted north to the banks of the Mandovi Before Portugal discovered its own sea route to India trade between Occident and Orient was monopolised by the Arabs When Albuquerque seized Goa and then Daman and Diu the Arabs sources were cut off Portugal took control of trade and built its empireuntil the Dutch French and English made inroads and the Portuguese empire began its irreversible decline as a world power The Portuguese doctor Garcia de Orta is famous for compiling the first major list of plants called Colloquios dos simplices and drogas e cousas medicinais da India 1567 It was perhaps the first modern effort at an inventory of plants Imported plants brought in by the Portuguese have enriched local plant diversity Five hundred years ago India had no potatoes groundnuts tomatoes or chillies These important crops were relative newcomers to Indian fields and cuisine Ports on the West Coast of IndiaSurat Bombay Dabhol Goa Honavar Mangalore and Cochinplayed a major role in the import and dispersal of these useful exotic plants Before medieval times Goa traded with African coast Egypt the Persian Gulf and SE Asia Oceanic and maritime trade brought exotic species to Indian shores and diversified regional plant genepools The growing demand for novel crops such as tobacco and pineapple led to the establishment of experimental nurseries and plantations mostly by missionaries The novelty and utility of many exotic plant species brought a change in the agricultural economy food habits and cultural practices of the Western Ghats and India as a whole By the early 18th century the cultivation of tobacco chillies chickoos guavas sitaphals pineapples oranges cashews papayas and breadfruit was established in South India including Goa India became one of the worlds largest producers of some of the imported crops Search 2025 Copyright Goa

standard setters examining government accounting for mineral wealth Goa Foundation December 14 2021 Since 2016 the Goa Foundation The Future We Need have advocated the correction of a crucial anomaly in the way governments account for the oil gas mineral wealth they control and dispose of through miners In Goa and across the world mineral sale proceeds eg royalty are incorrectly treated as revenue and spent as part of the budget The extraction however is actually leading to depletion of the mineral wealth cheating future generations of access when their turn arises as the minerals are finite in quantity and are not renewable Further the mineral wealth is being sold for less than its actual worth We are happy to announce that three key international standards setting bodies including the International Monetary Fund IMF have started work on resolving this issue as part of the process to update their accounting standards Since 2016 the Goa Foundation has been advocating for change with these bodies The Problem Accounting creates poor incentives In many countries governments own subsoil minerals Indias National Mineral Policy 2019 has declared Natural resources including minerals are a shared inheritance where the state is the trustee on behalf of the people to ensure that future generations receive the benefit of inheritance The primary objective of an owner or trustee is to maintain intact the capital represented by the shared mineral inheritance The extraction of oil gas and minerals is effectively the sale of the minerals with royalties and other proceeds being the consideration paid in exchange for the mineral wealth extracted Unfortunately governments everywhere treat the mineral sale proceeds as revenue or income a crucial error which hides the real transaction a sale of inherited wealth or assets This results in governments selling minerals at prices significantly lower than what they are worth driven by lobbying political donations and corruption For example it is estimated based on the annual reports of Vedanta that over the eight years 20042012 the state of Goa lost more than 95 of the value of its minerals after accounting for extraction costs and a reasonable profit for the extractor httpsbitlyCatastrophicFailureinGoa In effect the people and future generations of Goa have sold mineral wealth worth 100 for 5 a loss of 95 This plunder of public wealth is effectively a hidden perhead tax which made a few extractors and their cronies superrich Naturally the extractors are keen to extract as quickly as possible and move on Trees tigers tribals environmental activists are labeled as antidevelopment or antinational Worse still the trifles received by the government are treated as revenue and happily spent leaving neither the minerals nor their value for future generations to inherit This is hardly sustainable development Rulers love revenue it helps them stay in power If 5 is received from mining doubling mining would result in 10 of revenue Citizens perceive more mining more government revenue good The plunder outright spending of public wealth is hidden More mining under such conditions would make a bad situation significantly worse If the accounting were proper everyone would see that inherited mineral wealth of 100 is being sold Alternative questions come up naturally Why is inherited being sold Why now Can we avoid a loss How will we save the mineral wealth or its sale proceeds for future generations Who can fix this The single most important standard is the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 GFSM of the International Monetary Fund IMF The System of National Accounts 2008 SNA by UN Statistics is used for reporting national income statistics like GDP and NNI The broad conceptual framework of the SNA is used by the IMF for the GFSM The International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board IPSASB sets accounting standards for the public sector these parallel in some ways the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS that are designed for the private sector There are equivalent standards in India The Government Accounting Standards Advisory Board GASAB under the aegis of the CAG is the main standard setting body for government and national accounting Advocacy timeline In 2016 Goa Foundation sent the note Mitigating the Resource Curse by Improved Governmental Accounting to IMF IPSASB UN Stat and others globally as well as Indias GASAB and various officers in concerned ministries IPSASB responded promptly to inform that accounting for natural resources would be added as a potential project in their 2018 consultations for their Work Plan 201923 We got indirect feedback from the IMF as well In response Goa Foundation sent Government Accounting and the Resource Curse Response to FAQs to the same set of entities in 2017 In 2018 Goa Foundation responded to IPSASBs consultation Our advocacy was supported by a wide variety of civil society agencies including David Leiser President IAAP Economic Psychology Division Bob Traa retired from the IMF Publish What You Pay UK Samata India the Peaceful Society the Natural Resource Governance Institute Open Oil and The Future We Need This effort was successful IPSASB placed a New Standard on Natural Resources at the top of their priority list for their Work Plan 201923 noting From a public interest perspective this is an important issue particularly in jurisdictions with resourcebased and resource rich economies because the recognition and measurement of these assets impact their management and the benefits derived by citizens from their extraction Work commenced in 2019 A Consultation Paper is being drafted which will be issued after their March 2022 meeting In 2018 a third letter was sent to the IMF connecting the accounting error to opening up protected areas in the US for revenue towards tax cuts for the rich In response the head of IMFs Government Finance Statistics invited The Goa Foundation to meet Rahul Basu travelled to Washington DC and met with staff from a range of departments of the IMF From the meeting it became clear that the UN System of National Accounts would need to be corrected and the IMF GFSM would follow after The earlier advocacy notes culminated in publication of Minerals are a Shared Inheritance Accounting for the Resource Curse a research paper by Rahul Basu and Scott Pegg It was published in Elsevier journal The Extractives Industries and Society in 2020 In 2020 the Advisory Expert Group AEG to the InterSecretariat Working Group on National Accounts ISWGNA on the UN System of National Accounts created task forces to look at specific issues We were in touch with members of the Wellbeing and Sustainability Task Force and provided inputs to the draft guidance note on Accounting for Economic Ownership and Depletion of Natural Resources A public consultation was concluded earlier this year Finally earlier this year IMF has deputed experts on Government Finance Statistics to join the Wellbeing and Sustainability Task Force in the context of the updating the GFSM 2014 Accounting for Economic Ownership and Depletion of Natural Resources is one of the issues on the GFSM priority list Rahul Basu remarked We are thrilled that this issue is now on the agenda of all three important standards setters IMF IPSASB and UN Statistics This is a necessary and most difficult first step Of course changing international standards is a long process and may not result in all we advocate for And getting the changes adopted and implemented is still harder But the ball is rolling and that is a huge win Claude Alvares Director of the Goa Foundation noted The time spent in international advocacy has produced results which once they become part and parcel of the routine accounting standards run by institutions across the globe will lead to a wholly different sustainable conservationist approach to disposal of mineral wealth and assets In principle minerals are owned by the people of each state but presently they are badly managed leading to serious losses inequity and senseless depletion at the expense of coming generations The owners of the ore the citizens of the state get almost nothing In fact due to the environmental degradation caused by primitive extraction methods welfare is in fact being replaced by illfare leading to social unrest across the planet in all mining areas Such an industrial model of extraction violates Article 39 of the Constitution of India About The Goa Foundation is the most well known of Goas environmental action groups Founded in 1986 by a group of Goan environmentalists each fighting his or her own individual environmental battles the organization today commands the respect of judiciary government and the general public for persisting with its environment agenda for more than three decades The work of the Foundation spans different areas and fields all related in some way or another with the conservation of Goas natural environment The Future We Need is a global movement to make intergenerational equity foundational for civilization starting with minerals Ethical Government Accounting is our global campaign to change three critical standards for government accounting statistics and disclosure to treat mining as the sale of our shared inheritance The basic rationale is that since minerals are not recognized as assets governments are highly incentivized to enter into arrangement to sell them without concern about the value received because the mineral sale proceeds are treated as windfall revenue which the governments can spend Proper accounting would disclose that in most cases the mineral sale proceeds are lower than the value of the minerals the Resource Rent and consequently the real transaction is a firesale of the family silver This cheats present and future generations of their inheritance and drives the resource curse as well as makes our economies unsustainable This is unethical Contact Claude Alvares Director Goa Foundation 919552995186 goafoundationgmailcom Rahul Basu Member The Future We Need 919096039878 thefutureweneedgmailcom QA Is Goa an exception Is this a national or global issue There is growing empirical evidence of large losses in mining from around the world httpsbitlyGlobalLoss There is also growing evidence from the IMF that many governments of resource rich nations including the six Gulf Coordination Council countries UK and Norway face declining public sector net worth ie their governments are becoming poorer httpsbitlyPublicWealthDestruction This indicates unsustainable mining Links to the standards setters websites IPSASB Project on Natural Resources UN Statistics Consultation on Accounting for the Economic Ownership and Depletion of Natural Resources UN Statistics also produces the System of EnvironmentalEconomic Accounting UNSEEA which is used for green accounting IMF Update to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 GASAB Is this connected to green accounting Green accounting is the term given to national accounts which take into account the value of nature The rationale is that the national accounts under the UN SNA standard treats nature as free leading to rapid exploitation In response the UN System of Enviromental Economic Accounting UNSEEA was developed as satellite accounts and addon to the national accounts The reason for green accounting is similar to our proposal and has inspired our work In our case our focus is on the government or public sector accounts as they are the owner trustee of the mineral resources Further we have concentrated on mineral resources as they have clear financial values and do not regenerate IPSASB found that there is almost no guidance in accounting standards across the world for owners of mineral and natural resources For national income accounting since the consequences of this error are so significant we have targeted a change to the main statistics UN SNA so that it impacts the reported GDP In fact seen properly the national goal should be Net National Income NNI not GDP Both these aspects have been included in the UN Stat guidance note If the error is corrected what could change Since minerals are a shared inheritance held in trust for the people and future generations our foremost duty is to maintain the value of our childrens inheritance by avoiding theft loss waste or consumption Leaving the minerals undisturbed fulfills our duty Goa Foundation Benchmark for Public Finance If we extract and sell our mineral wealth The Goa Foundation has proposed a passive benchmark for evaluating fiscal performance with the shared mineral inheritance It suggests that since capital maintenance is the first objective losses must be avoided when selling the mineral wealth and the entire sale proceeds must be invested in a new nonwasting asset specifically a Future Generations Fund FGF passively invested overseas in a global portfolio of lowcost index funds to earn the global market rate of return The benchmark also proposes that after making good any losses including reinvesting for inflation the real income of the FGF be distributed equally to all as owners Achieving Zero Loss while managing wealth suggests the application of best practices from the financial sector including Zero Loss as a legal goal a high security mineral supply chain fit and proper person tests and integrity due diligence on all participants in the mineral supply chain and whistleblower rewards and protection Setting a global judicial precedent in 2014 the Supreme Court ordered the creation of a Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund which already has a corpus of around Rs500 crore Goa Foundation vs UOI Ors WP civil 435 of 2012 judgment on April 21 2014 httpsbitly2Kts4gA The Supreme Court is yet to decide on the use or investment of the fund corpus as well as what distributions can take place if any For the economy a this is sustainable capital has been maintained b the savings rate would rise making available more long term domestic capital c it diversifies risk while likely improving returns it is nearly impossible to outperform the market rate of return d the dividend is in effect a Universal Basic Income e lower inequality leads to higher economic performance and f as budgets no longer have easy mining money public investment and tax administration will become more effective and efficient This is a six fold economic boost Principles of Fair Mining The Goa Foundation Benchmark can be communicated in five simple principles 1 Natural resources including minerals are owned by the state as a trustee on behalf of the people and especially future generations Public Trust DoctrinePublic Domain 2 As we have inherited the minerals we must ensure future generations inherit either the minerals or their full value Intergenerational Equity Principle 3 If we extract and sell our mineral wealth we must ensure Zero Loss ie we must capture the full economic rent sale price minus cost of extraction and a reasonable profit for the extractor Any loss is a loss to all of us and all future generations 4 The entire mineral sale proceeds must be saved in a Future Generations Fund with the state as trustee for the people and especially future generations 5 Distribute only the real income of the fund only as a Citizens Dividend equally to all as a right of ownership These principles of fair mining are fully Constitutional promoting justice liberty equality and fraternity They are moral ethical fair right and sustainable The reduction in losses would limit corruption crony capitalism and growing inequality They fulfill our duties to our future generations To discuss this post leave a comment to our Facebook page Search 2025 Copyright Goa Foundation Powered by WordPress HTML5 Blank"

Rapid Enhancement of Decentralised Municipal Waste Processing Capacity in the State of Goa Signature Date I Narrative Report Brief description of project objectives and purpose Goa is a premier international tourism designation Management of garbage generated by the tourism industry and from domestic sources has not kept pace with the recent developments In fact the villages had no heritage of any system for collection or disposal of garbage The Municipal Councils had a system but this was only in the major urban areas like Panaji and Mapusa The waste was collected and indiscriminately and haphazardly dumped in unsecured landfills The absence of any trained capacity for handling solid wastes has lead to the violation of the MSW Rules 2000 and rapid degradation of land and environment Despite the issue of solid waste occupying the attention of the High Court and the Supreme Court nothing was changing on the ground since statutory bodies just did not know what to do their staff were either nonexistence or untrained and most important their priorities appeared to be elsewhere As a result the hitherto beautiful state has become a litterchoked state and this is having adverse consequences on tourism potential Even if tourism did not generate additional garbage the handling of domestic garbage has reached a stage where it could have serious consequences for the local population The main objective of the UNGEF project in Goa was to provide and also initiate the implementation of long term institutional solutions to the persistent problem of domestic waste generated by a variety of agents including factories resorts schools colonies and even individual families in the state The specific goal of the project was to create an institutional capacity with statutory and institutional managers for environmentally safe handling and processing of solid wastes into environmentally friendly and economically valuable materials using a combination of composting vermiculture and EMmicrobial technology We wanted more people trained in the knowledge and processes involved in garbage handling and processing B Activities and outputs of the project Project components Activities Expected Results outcomes outputs as planned Results achieved Actual achievements Remarks Training knowledge and management workshops including practicals for identified personnel from major stakeholders involved in generation and handling of municipal solid waste The project intended to train all the conservancy staff of 13 existing Municipal Councils as well as many of the coastal village panchayats that are suffering the most Also included was training of a number of schools in north Goa We have been able to train 10 of the municipal councils and a number of panchayats and schools We have also conducted a number of awareness programs in villages Three Councils simply refused to respond to our repeated invitations including visits to organise such training courses Since these Councils are in the remote areas like Valpoi where too much solid waste is not generated the project did not pursue them further Extensive erection of waste converting units for use through vermiculture and EM technology Designs have been perfected after year long trials and are successful and have also been installed in a number of places The project was to construct around 30 vermiculture units as well as bring awareness among the people Make them aware that EM is an environmentally friendly product for such purposes as well We have achieved double the number than proposed in the project There are 40 vermiculture units that are constructed and run successfully all over There is a significant part of the population that has understood the importance of segregation and the need for waste management at home The use of EM has also increased exponentially in Goa and there are many residences that are using this product at home In addition to this there are eight hotels using the product as well for total sanitation and hygiene purposes Overachieved Strengthening the pool of expertise within the organization so that it can continue to function as a nodal agency for improving efficiency monitoring and tackling failures if and when these occur The project was to train the staff of the organization in construction and maintenance of the units and use of EM The organization has well trained and expert people that are able to construct the unit on their own We have gone further and now handle dump sites and large scale meatfish processing units as well We are developing expertise now in the handling of plastic litter C Were these objectives and the purpose met In our modest opinion substantially yes We conducted the training programmes for the major municipal councils in Goa We overachieved targets for construction of vermicompost solutions and EM extension We successfully took over Goas largest garbage dump and mitigated its worse excesses training municipal workers in the process We successfully put up and ran the only major fishmeat processing unit for Mapusa municipality We were able to demonstrate experimental use of garbage for rehabilitation of degraded mining sites and create a credible market for use of compost generated from solid waste processing sites D If not what were the principal obstacles The principal obstacle to sustainable achievement in solid waste management comes from the elected councils and panchayats For some reason these bodies continue to place garbage processing and handling at the lowest of their priorities We have not succeeded in finding a way out of this situation We have failed in getting longterm commitments and interest sustained despite getting orders from the High Court in these matters Councillors and panchas get elected for routine reasons of making money etc The corruption we have seen in the two years of the project is very depressing A significant number of municipal workers are actually doing personal work of the councilors concerned They are not available for the work for which the council pays them Persons trained by us for the various processes of waste segregation baling of waste plastic composting EM preparation and treatment are taken off the site without explanations and new ones designated While this has enabled us to train a larger number of workers stability of operations at dump sites is often threatened by such measures E How could these obstacles been avoided What advice would you give to other organizations designing similar projects To bypass this lack of apathy we decided to concentrate more on nonmunicipal stakeholders like hotels housing colonies etc where the response was decidedly better This produced better results for the energy expended In the case of the councils too much time was lost in just getting things to work Despite us offering our services free of cost the attitude appeared to be as if the council was doing the organization a favour We feel therefore that in the state of Goa at least the situation at the local body level is so depressing that too many efforts should not be expended in this direction It is far better to work at the community level especially building societies colonies factories hotels etc so that awareness and concern for the environment through intelligent handling of wastes becomes a norm and thereafter a pressure on the local authorities as well For example we handle now the largest garbage dump in Goa Sonsoddo Though we have managed the site and mitigated its worst environmental excesses no councilor ever visits the site or shows any interest The municipal employees are also unconcerned Citizens are concerned with what happens there but rarely persons from the council F What were the principal impacts lessons learnt form the project The major impact of the project is the amount of awareness that it has generated among the various government authorities and the public at large More and more people including the principal generators of solid waste like hotels and factories are now approaching the Goa Foundation for assistance either in setting up vermicomposting bins or in the use of EM for their premises or homes A number of residences have moved to the use of EM and earthworms thus generating valuable compost as well as contributing towards the safety of the environment This aspect of the project has been well documented as well and is easily visible The project has been premised on the need to train municipal workers These training sessions have been largely completed However since we found that Municipal authorities still need specific guidance in actually planning and running a management scheme for handling waste collection and treatment systems for the solid wastes generated in their areas based on environmentally friendly technology we have taken that up as a project objective as well In this area we handle two projects we supervise the Sonsoddo dump site on behalf of the Margao Municipal Council and the fishmeat processing unit at Mapusa for the Mapusa Municipal Council G What were the principal deficiencies missing gaps in the project We were not able to complete all 13 municipal councils Despite visits phone calls and letters the councils refused to respond But these were a minority The main difficulty was that in the ones that cooperated the concerned Municipal Chief Officers took a number of days to fix dates for the training programmes In fact we were able to get the District Magistrate to issue circulars for these training programmes Besides this there were no other major problems In housing colony areas the main problem faced by GF staff was that the flat owners did not give segregated waste even after meeting them several times and explaining them the entire concept Since the waste was not segregated additional labour had to be requisitioned Even after having a number of visits to the village panchayats we were unable to set up waste collection plants nonbiodegradable in villages In Colvale we were able to get the place to set up the plant but the problem was of getting the community involved in the project Panchayats are very unreliable H Benefits achieved forby participants participants communities during implementation All the vermiculture units constructed are running successfully because they are being periodically monitored Those who have constructed them are also very pleased with their functioning and with the result compost The community is involved at the interception as they are involved in the segregation of the garbage generated We are surprised at the extent of use of EM through our efforts We began EM sales in Goa at 100 litres every three to four months We have now reached a figure of 200 litres every month The individual transaction is worth Rs30000 Every month we order that much This works out to Rs336000 per year Use is expanding I Products generated by the project eg Publications Brochures Videos CDs educational materials models infrastructure awards marketable goods etc The NGO has prepared brochures on the use of EM as well as on vermicomposting which have been widely circulated The EM brochure clearly gives instruction on how to use the solution and in what proportion for different purposes The vermicomposting brochure gives details on the construction of a small household unit It gives the requirements as well as the cost for the construction of such unit The brochure explains how one can carry out vermicomposting at home with a minimum cost The NGO has also prepares slides and a power point presentation for the purpose of caring out training programs in schools and colleges J Assessment of impact of project in the GEF focal area At the moment we are the only group actively assisting municipal councils panchayats and other stakeholders like hotels and colonies in the State with concrete and feasible solutions which they can implement through their own workers trained by us We are successfully building pressure on the Goa government and on all local bodies to think seriously about garbage and environment friendly modes of disposal We are seriously participating in discussions for the establishment of a dozen municipal waste treatment facilities in the State We expect to be involved in monitoring their effectiveness and functioning as well K Press media coverage links established in the project to other similar initiatives networking with other NGOs A lot of press coverage is available about the work of the UNGEF project We had a press conference at the Sonsoddo garbage rehabilitation site which was addressed by the Minister for Urban Development After which we had a tea party at the site We also had a detailed press coverage regarding the vermicomposting units in the Goan Observer We are connected to other similar initiatives in India through attending meetings with the Alliance for Waste AWM Management and Toxics Link which has a discussion group and daily emails of similar work being done in other states We have attended two nationallevel meetings of AWM shared details of our work and benefited from exchange with other persons and NGOs working on solid wastes L Future plans if any to continue expand or replicate project activities We shall continue to maintain the core group expertise that we have successfully achieved through the project It is a valuable community resource available to all those facing a garbage disposal problem We intend to get into plastic waste processing and provide solutions there as well One additional area we hope to take up is working with the ragpickers to ensure better conditions of work and safeguarding of children and their education M Additional information if any in terms of awards and certificates of merit etc None available II Financial report of expenditures Budget

intended to be a comprehensive list and it is understood that projects will only cover some aspects Try to be as specific analytical and didactic as possible We shall appreciate if you can also substantiate the report with supportive documents letters and evidences Describe the effects of this project in relation to the GEF focal areas and operational programs Explain how the project was able to have an effect on biodiversity climate change or international waters Assess the potential global benefits of this project The global benefits of the project are connected with the effective management of solid waste dumping sites which have hitherto been a significant source of green house gases and incineration of hazardous waste leading to generation of dioxins and furans We have always felt that even if we succeed in bringing the fires at dumpsites to a halt this would be a significant achievement We have already achieved this objective in the case of the Sonsoddo site Did this project link the practice of sustainable livelihoods to a GEF focal area Describe the strategies employed indicating what works and what does not Only indirectly The major industry in this area of operations is tourism which can be managed effectively in a sustainable manner The generation of garbage in large quantities has placed the industry in severe danger The project has concerned itself with the problem from this angle and suggested solutions Is this a communitydriven project How was community implementation and ownership of project achieved How did this contribute to project success Also indicate pitfalls and tactics to be avoided Explain issues regarding to community participation and ownership of roles and issues Goa should be seen as a small relatively homogenous community which has a definite selfperception The smallness of the State enables a community orientation and vision for most actions and campaigns Typically most campaigns are of allGoa character The Goan community is very environment conscious and has emerged as a group that will take strong decisions when its environment is concerned One of the successes of the project has been to convince groups of people to handle their own wastes instead of dumping these on illequipped municipal councils For example it has set up a number of vermicomposting units within housing colonies which are run by the societies themselves A significant section of people within the communities are also now using EM for cleaning Our project was NGOdriven rather than community driven from the start From the beginning we have acted as a strong pressure agency that was equipped to provide solutions at individual colony institution and government level for garbage related issues Was there a capacitybuilding component in this project How were local capacities enhanced How did it contribute to project success Also what links have been established for them to sustain this as a process As mentioned earlier that one of the major component of the project is training knowledge and management workshops including practicals We have tried to enable municipal council staff and workers from various institutions how to understand waste its decomposition and conversion into a useful product A number of training programmes were organized for Municipal councils panchayats schools and colleges During the training program different local and global environmental problems were discussed The participants were taken for field trips and site visits That two municipal councils invited the organization to run their garbage disposal sites is a measure of the confidence developed in the organization and its capabilities A number of schools have constructed their own vermiculture units where they are doing composting A number of housing colonies now run their own units with their conservancy staff trained by the Goa Foundation in collecting segregation and treatment of such wastes Has this project increased public awareness of local and global environmental problems Describe how this was done and whether people are making use of the new knowledge With which concerned departments stakeholders links have been established In the project we have organized a number of awareness programmes During these programmes the different global environmental problems were discussed But more stress was given to local problems such as garbage management segregation EM use for cleaning etc We have also organized street plays and rallies with college students in a number of villages A number of schools also participated in such programs We have constructed 60 vermiculture units which are all running successfully and which are being frequently visited by curious officials and persons so interested There are some units that are maintained by the unit owners themselves Large sections of people know the importance of environment and have shifted to the use of EM as a cleaning agent Even some hotels and wellknown companies in Goa are using EM for different purposes How did women and men participate in planning implementing and evaluating the project Did project proponents plan a gender focus Or did it evolve in the course of project implementation What are some of the issues that came up in this regard The project did not have a specific gender focus Was this project run by indigenous people or involve significant participation by indigenous people In this context discuss ethnic cultural and historical factors that affected project design implementation and results Discuss the impacts that the projects have made in the area The project was not run by indigenous people as normally understood However all staff recruited for training were from the State How has the sustainability plan andor prospects been addressed What aspects of the project design project implementation or other factors enhanced sustainability How could other projects or country programmes use this experience to promote sustainability The project was to enhance at a decentralized level the capacity to handle and treat waste This was sought to be achieved by propagating technologies such as EM and vermicomposting that are themselves sustainable and renewable It has created a pool of expertise within the organization so that it can continue to function as a nodal agency for improving efficiency monitoring and tackling failures if and when these occur To sustain longterm involvement the Goa Foundation has set up a nonprofit company under section 25 of the companies Act 1956 called Green Goa Works This company in effect will remain as a permanent source of information and expertise available to institutional agents in relation to these technologies and new ones that will emerge in the future Green Goa Works will eventually carry on with the task of providing technical and other services for a fee that will ensure its survival in the near future till such time as the waste problem is brought under hand The company is already earning revenue for maintaining its staff from maintenance contracts and fees and from sale of EM products in the State How the project received cofinancing If so indicate sources and amounts Which project components did the cofinancing support How was the cofinancing obtained Describe how links to other donors or agencies were made networking strategies and negotiations Also indicate pitfalls and tactics to be avoided Cofinancing has been overachieved The Goa Foundation undertook three main subprojects Two of these were with the Municipal councils and one with the Dempo mining corporation The project with the Margao Municipal council was rehabilitation of the Sonsoddo garbage site in Margao The Goa Government financed this project The money was spent by the MMC but will be reimbursed by the Goa Government The project cost is 253218800 The Mapusa Municipal Council spent Rs43839900 for the fish cum meat waste treatment unit at the fish market The unit was constructed and operated by municipal staff under the technical supervision of the Foundation The Dempo Mining Corporation spent over Rs10000000 for its mine restoration project based on use of EM and treated garbage The project is undertaken at the reject dump in the mining lease in Bicholim Over here the DMC received agro and market waste from the Mapusa and Bicholim Municipal Councils and converted it into compost using EM under GF supervision The project also conducted a number of training programs for Municipal councils panchayats schools and colleges Some of the costs of the training sessions at the Municipal Council and panchayat level have been borne by the respective authorities They did arrangements for the hall LCD projectors arrangement of snacks and food for the participants providing material etc The amount varied depending where the training program was conducted In case of the Municipal councils it went up to 20000 to 30000 while in the panchayats it was two to three thousand They also did all the arrangements thus the payments were also done by them More than 60 units have bee erected by individual stakeholders including housing colonies for vermicomposting units The combined investment in these units alone works out to Rs5 lakhs or more Is this project suitable for replication in other communities or regions Could it be upscaled to a mediumsized GEF project Please indicate any plans in this regard How would you like this to be addressed and financed The project could easily be replicated in other areas of the country There is no element with in the project as conceived that will militate against its use in other parts of the country The technologies that are used are very simple and can be handled by uneducated people slumdwellers peasants etc It does not require the purchase of heavy equipments Earthworms that are used are replicable in simple environments and generate revenue The EM technology that is used is a very simple technology and can be replicated anywhere Initial investment is very less All the elements of the technology are readily available in the country The most significant aspect of the programme was that it provided a stead core group of expertise for persons involved in garbage processing Those interested took advantage of its services The project proponents kept pressure on the authorities throughout for a proper management system for the wastes on the grounds that its own experience with waste management proved that large investments were not necessarily required It is a sad experience of modern democratic India that though technical solutions are readily available statutory bodies are least inclined to provide real services in an efficient manner People are helpless in the matter Once in a way a Mr Rao at Surat or a Mr Chandrashekar at Nagpur get into the act and demonstrate that the same system with a committed individual at the top can work wonders to maintain general cleanliness and involve citizens as well in the process Alas that is not the happy fate of the rest of India In such circumstances NGOs have to be supported where they promise they can show the way Only such constituents of civil society can catalyse action and indicate that there is scope for positive action in these areas and energise the rest of civil society as well Were there links between this project and the overall GEF How were these links achieved How have they benefited the GEFSGP How have they benefited the GEF How did GEFSGP help the NGO Communities to leverage better resources from various other sources There was not much interaction between the GEF and the project Though there was a midterm review no report of the review was written up by the consultants who visited the organization and so the organization could not benefit from the insights of the consultants Has this project influenced government policy Explain what the government policy is how it has been affected and the role and nature of GEFSGP influence Yes The Goa Foundation has maintained pressure on the Government directly and through the High Court to ensure that attention is brought to bear on the matter of handling municipal wastes This includes lobbying with the Government for safe disposal of plastic wastes The Foundation itself made several proposals for running existing dumpsites at Mapusa Panaji and Margao Eventually the Margao proposal was accepted but based on the insistence of the project on an execution through the municipal council and its workers and with only technical supervision from the Foundation The entire work was done free for the council The support of the UNGEF was officially communicated to the council The project has sought to pressurize government to go in for independent garbage processing plants since the municipal councils are thoroughly disinclined to deal with these issues This has now resulted in the government selecting a consultant to advise it on the selection of several plants for the various municipal councils The Foundation will be involved in monitoring the efficiency of these plants and to report failures if any so that prompt action for remediation can be initiated Search 2025 Copyright Goa Foundation Powered by WordPress HTML5 Blank"

Town and Country Planning Act 1974 March 14 2025 In a judgment having far reaching ecological and financial implications the High Court of Bombay at Goa comprising Justice MS Karnik and Justice Ms Nivedita Mehta virtually struck down the power of the government to unilaterally alter the zoning of private plots at the request of private owners and to thus alter the sacrosanct land use notified in respect of these plots in the statutory Regional Plan for Goa 2021 The land use changes at stake on the day of the judgment amounted to some 265 lakh sq mts all allowed under a fictitious claim that the zoning of these areas was either an instance of inadvertent error or incoherentinconsistent zoning What did petitioners Goa Foundation Goa Bachao Abhiyan and Khazan Society of Goa ask and get in PIL WP 162023 The petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the law itself 172 of the TCP Act 1974 This provision introduced into the TCP Act in 2023 enabled the Government to change the zoning of individual plots on the basis of an application made by private parties Such applications could claim that the zoning as shown in the Regional Plan 2021 was in the nature of an inadvertent error or was an instance of incoherent or inconsistent zoning In the alternative the petitioners pleaded for reading down the 172 amendment letting it remain on the statute book but ensuring it was disemboweled of its capacity for doing any damage to the Regional Plan The petition also challenged the constitutionality of the Rules notified to operate 172 the Guidelines which elaborated through examples on the meaning of the terms inadvertent error and inconsistent and incoherent zoning provisions and the constitution of the Scrutiny Committee set up to recommend private applications for zone change Reading down a provision of law like Sec 172 involves construing the language of the provision in a manner that limits its scope or application making it consistent with constitutional or legal principles So by restricting its meaning or reading it down the court makes it workable to salvage and save the provision from invalidation since it has been passed by an elected legislature In essence the rule of reading down serves as a tool for the judiciary to strike a balance between upholding constitutional principles Articles 14 and 21 and respecting the intention of the legislature This the court does by interpreting statutory provisions in the present case the ideas of inadvertent error and terms like incoherent and inconsistent zoning So in its judgment the Court has not struck down the constitutional validity of 172 but it has read it down that is reduced the scope of its application drastically by interpreting the section and what it can only mean when read within the context of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution and other constitutional principles In actual fact the provision of section 172 now stands mostly eviscerated The Court has also struck down the validity of the Rules and Guidelines notified by the Government for the purpose of implementing 172 Thus in one fell stroke all permissions granted earlier under 172 amounting to 265 lakh sq mts will fall since the rules and guidelines under which these zone changes were made are now quashed If we consider that zone changes cost the applicant Rs1000 per sq mt the amount of money lost amounts to Rs260 crore The Court has also held that it will not be permissible to rezone individual plots without reference to the zoning of RP 21 This in effect means that Government cannot direct zone changes because the Government thinks that the zoning is incorrect or erroneous Any possibility of zone change must be considered only visavis the zoning proposals in the Regional Plan itself Applications from private parties cannot be entertained on their own merit Further any consideration of a proposal for zone change must follow the scheme of the TCP Act In this light it has injuncted the Goa government from entertaining any further applications or granting any further approvals under 172 The court in fact has conclusively held that changes under Section 172 cannot be in public interest One more significant decision of the Court is to quash and set aside the work of the Scrutiny Committee which purportedly examined 172 proposals and applications The court has held that the TCP Board did not have the statutory power to set up such a committee and delegate its powers to it It is on the request of the state governments counsel that the High Court has stayed the operation of its order for 6 weeks in order to enable the state government to appeal the order before the Supreme Court But not without bringing to complete halt any further zone changes under Sec 172 in the State of Goa Extracts It cannot be forgotten that a change of zone directly has an effect on a planned development and that too in respect of an ecosystem which is as fragile as Goa The environmental concerns in a region like Goa which has 5406 1885943700 m\u00b2 of ECO zone1 and 2629 1163442300 m\u00b2 of ecozone2 will have to far outweigh the interest of private owners 186 The whole purpose of planned development is to ensure that the planning is not haphazardly done The RP is prepared in public interest The whole idea in providing for zone is that the development takes place within those zones and elaborate procedure and a scientific methodology is followed in preparing the RP The survey is a comprehensive survey The RP may be for a particular region which may comprise of a part of a State or a larger area so far as Goa is concerned The RP 2021 is for the entire State of Goa The RP for Goa is prepared bearing in mind the fragile ecosystem in Goa In respect of RP2021 or for that matter when a new RP is to be prepared an elaborate exercise is carried out while proposing the zone This passes through various layers Surveys are conducted by the CTP The Board makes its recommendations and public comments are invited The Government notifies the RP The RP is thus a holistic document which keeps in mind the aspirations of the people and overall it is in public interest 21 The 2023 Rules confer unfettered and unguided authority on the Executive to interpret what is meant by an inadvertent error or what is an inconsistentincoherent zoning proposal There is no guidance in the 2023 Rules itself as to what is an inadvertent error or incoherent or inconsistent zoning proposals The power is openended The Act or the Rules do not prescribe any guidance for exercising such power There is no doubt that the inadvertent errors can be corrected and even the petitioners say so but cannot be expanded to the extent prescribed by the Guidelines We are satisfied that the manner in which the rules are framed and the circular issued is not in furtherance of a development in public interest by maintaining a balance between sustainable development vizaviz the environmental issues but is concerned with the interest of private land owners For example since it is a matter of record and even according to the State as on 02012025 there have been 353 approvals under Section 172 which affects an area of about 2654286 square meters This may be a minuscule percentage as contended by Mr Devitre learned Senior Advocate appearing for the State but the applications are being filed entertained and conversions granted for which there is no outer limit Almost all the conversions are from paddy fields natural cover no development zone and orchard to settlement zones Such plotbyplot conversion creating a zone within a zone virtually has the effect of mutilating the RP prepared after such an elaborate exercise 22 To discuss this post leave a comment to our Facebook page Search 2025 Copyright
