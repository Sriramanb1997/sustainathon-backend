Oct 23 2024 3 min read Voices for Asian Elephants has bought 4 acres of private land abutting forest in Nilambur and is rewilding it to create a safe corridor for elephants in the area Even as the Kerala government takes several measures to attract foreign investment stakeholders face many difficulties in executing even environmentfriendly projects Sangita Iyer founder Voices for Asian Elephants an organisation working for the conservation of wild elephant corridors and restoration of their habitats shares her experience in buying four acres of land in the State for a project to ease humanelephant conflict and foster peaceful coexistence between people and wild animals She highlights the bureaucratic hurdles involved and the smear campaigns the organisation had to face You have been working on a project that aims at giving forestland encroached upon by people decades ago back to animals The project to create awareness of the conservation of elephant habitats has almost materialised after around five years What is the project all about Its a simple project We purchased around four acres of land at Nilambur which abuts the forest to create a safe corridor for elephants in the area The land is connected to Karimpuzha Wildlife Sanctuary the Kerala side of Silent Valley National Park and Mukkuruthy National Park in Tamil Nadu side and has high conservation value The aim is to ensure continuity of elephant habitat It was a plantation area and we removed the electric fencing set up there by planters and closed the wells in the region The space is now completely left open for natural rewilding What are the salient features of the project The 4acre plot is now a safe corridor and approximately 340 elephants can use the land to traverse between two forest patches thus helping alleviate the humanelephant conflict in the region This will also prevent inbreeding and ensure genetic flow between herds aiding the survival of an endangered species Buying back forestland that belongs to wildlife is critical and is the only longterm measure to ensure harmonious coexistence Why did this project take around five years to complete First we admit the complexity of land purchase regulations in India particularly for foreign organisations such as ours We facilitated the acquisition of land through our local partner Nature Mates in 2023 and subsequently initiated the transfer process to the Kerala Forest department We raised the funds for the project in 2020 amidst the COVID19 pandemic We spent around 60000 approximately 50 lakh for the project including legal expenses It took around five tedious years to complete the proceedings Given that this was our first land purchase project in India we learnt many lessons We had to face smear campaigns and allegations propagated by the Kerala Independent Farmers Association KIFA regarding the transfer of land for conservation purposes The bureaucratic hurdles inherent in the land transfer process and the tedious and inefficient nature of these procedures led to delays However the cooperation of Forest department officials is worth mentioning particularly Forest department secretary KR Jyothilal officials like Prakriti Srivastava Vijayanand former South Nilambur DFO Praveen Kumar and our local partner Nature Mates for making this project a reality Have you achieved your goal now Do you have any intention to make the private land trapped inside the forest available to animals The process that may take around two to three months in foreign countries is almost over now although we are still awaiting official declaration of the land as protected forest In fact there are around 60 acres of land inside the forest with private players and they have contacted us to acquire their land as well Given the experience the Board of Directors will reconsider future land deals Our main objective of purchasing the land and transferring it to the State government is to highlight the issue of conserving elephant habitats their migratory pathways and corridors which will help mitigate the humanelephant conflict by preventing them from straying out of their habitats fostering

Sangita Iyer Dec 2 2024 3 min read Los Angeles November 15 2024 In an inspiring technological breakthrough AIbased devices are being deployed to protect Indias elephants from train collisions a leading cause of elephant deaths in the region Sangita Iyer founder of Voices for Asian Elephants Society VFAES has spearheaded this innovative approach with the introduction of EleSense an AIpowered alert system designed to detect and warn train conductors of nearby elephants allowing conductors time to slow down and prevent tragic accidents UnchainedTVs Jane VelezMitchell and cohost Lindsey Baker interviewed Sangita Iyer to find out more and you can watch their entire conversation here Donate Now to Save Indias Elephants Each Device Costs 2000 This gamechanging technology is not only saving elephants but also transforming Indias conservation landscape With hundreds of elephant deaths due to train accidents in recent years the EleSense technology offers a practical and urgently needed solution now being implemented across highrisk rail corridors in West Bengal with 30 devices to be installed soon inside Indias famed Chapramari Wildlife Sanctuary EleSense technology employs an intricate system of sensors capable of identifying the presence of elephants through thermal imaging movement patterns and even animal height identification Once an elephant is detected on or near the tracks the system sends an immediate alert to the railway and forest departments The railway staff then notify train conductors via walkietalkie enabling them to slow down or stop the train if needed According to Iyer EleSense devices installed in 2023 alone have helped prevent 627 trainelephant collisions She says Last year we installed 40 devices across certain areas where accidents take place more frequently For those 40 devices we ended up raising 80000 The AIbased approach combines local expertise with cuttingedge innovation highlighting a promising collaboration between indigenous technology developers and animal protectionists A Widespread Need for AI Solutions in Wildlife Protection The Elephant Matrix series on UnchainedTV The EleSense initiative not only showcases AIs potential in wildlife conservation and animal welfare but also highlights the importance of protecting elephants revered cultural icons in India and critical components of forest ecosystems These gentle giants often traverse train tracks on their migratory paths but the encroachment of human activity and expanding rail infrastructure pose increasing risks There are now plans to install additional devices But Iyer needs the publics help in the form of donations What were doing this year is installing 30 devices in a core elephant range called the Chapramari Wildlife Sanctuary and then along with that were also installing 30 EleSense devices inside the Buxa Tiger Reserve Sangita Iyer is also the author of the Amazon bestseller Gods in Shackles What Elephants Can Teach Us About Empathy Resilience and Freedom She also produced the series Elephant Matrix streaming on UnchainedTV and the documentary Gods in Shackles A Model for Global Conservation As EleSense technology gains recognition the potential for similar AIdriven initiatives to protect other wildlife species worldwide is significant Iyer would love to adapt this technology to safeguard Africas elephants as well as other large wild animals at risk of human conflict anywhere in the world This collaborative conservation model grounded in AI and community support represents a scalable solution for protecting wildlife everywhere She explains more This is absolutely transferable to any location not just to save elephants but to save all wildlife Can you imagine if we had something like this that could alert us Its just that they need to be installed at certain levels and all the computer programming needs to be changed for specific animals For instance if it is a cougar a fox or a tiger we have different modules for that The EleSense project funded by donations underscores how public support can have a tangible impact on wildlife protection As Iyer explains every contribution directly supports the purchase and deployment of these lifesaving devices Her organization invites donations through VFAESorg empowering individuals to participate in meaningful conservation efforts that can potentially expand to other regions and species Deploying Practical Solutions to a Host of Wildlife Challenges Sangita Iyers mission has extended beyond deploying EleSense devices Through VFAES she advocates for broader measures For example she is working toward establishing wildlife corridors by purchasing land to facilitate safe passage for elephant herds thus reducing humanwildlife conflict and inbreeding She is also working on the rewilding of degraded habitats to ensure longterm survival for elephants And she is raising funds to install sophisticated robotic elephants to be used in place of real

Elephants Sangita Iyer Dec 11 2024 5 min read Click the image to read the full article Sangita Iyer is an internationally acclaimed environmental educator journalist and filmmaker dedicated to protecting Indias Asian elephants Best known for her awardwinning documentary Gods in Shackles which exposed the mistreatment of captive elephants Iyer brought international attention to their plight Through her nonprofit organization Voice for Asian Elephants Society VFAES she continues to champion cuttingedge AIbased technology for elephant conservation from launching robotic elephants to preventing train collisions with elephants to planting elephantfriendly saplings creating sustainable solutions that benefit both wildlife and local communities In a recent interview Iyer highlighted her ongoing efforts to merge science cultural sensitivity and storytelling to drive impactful change for elephants and the people living alongside them Q WHAT INSPIRED THE CREATION OF YOUR DOCUMENTARY SERIES ASIAN ELEPHANTS101 AND WHAT IMPACT DO YOU HOPE IT WILL HAVE ON CONSERVATION EFFORTS The inspiration for creating Asian Elephants 101 was deeply personal My first documentary Gods in Shackles which was nominated at the United Nations General Assembly and won 13 international film festival awards focused solely on the plight of captive elephants Their suffering especially in the southern regions of India where they are exploited in the name of culture and religion is heartbreaking But as I delved deeper I realized there was an even more urgent crisis affecting their wild counterparts Wild elephants have lost 80 of their natural habitat and the resulting humanelephant conflicts are taking a devastating toll on both the elephants and the communities that live in the forest fringes I felt an overwhelming need to shine a light on this to show that their suffering is not just a conservation issueits a moral issue Through Asian Elephants 101 I hope to awaken a sense of empathy and urgency in people inspiring them to take action to protect these majestic creatures and preserve the ecosystems theyre so vital to Ultimately I hope this series ignites change leading to stronger conservation efforts and policies that will ensure elephants can roam free for generations to come Q HOW HAS YOUR EXPERIENCE IN BROADCAST JOURNALISM INFLUENCED YOUR APPROACH TO CONSERVATION STORYTELLING PARTICULARLY IN YOUR WORK WITH NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Broadcast journalism taught me the power of storytelling through sights sounds and images to shape public perception and inspire action Whether its a news piece or a documentary the heart of conservation storytelling lies in capturing authentic emotional moments that resonate with audiences By creating a space where interviewees feel comfortable and speak honestly their stories become powerful tools for change My background in science and broadcasting allows me to simplify complex issues and craft compelling narratives which is why I was able to become a National Geographic Explorerusing storytelling to drive impact Q CAN YOU SHARE HOW YOU NAVIGATE THE CHALLENGES OF PROMOTING CONSERVATION WHILE ENSURING THE FAIR TREATMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES LIVING ON THE FRINGES OF FORESTS IN INDIA In Odisha we empower tribal communities by employing them to plant elephantfriendly saplings and build water holescreating vital resources for elephants while providing jobs for the people Bygiving locals a stake in conservation theyre more compassionate toward the elephants they share the land with Too often conservationists focus solely on wildlife neglecting the human sidewhich breeds resentment Our approach is different we foster a sense of coexistence where both people and elephants thrive together Its about creating harmony between nature and communities ensuring mutual care and survival Q WHAT STRATEGIES DO YOU USE TO INTEGRATE CULTURAL SENSITIVITY INTO YOURCONSERVATION PROJECTS ESPECIALLY WHEN ADDRESSING PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS Cultural sensitivity is at the heart of everything we do In India many communities near forests hold elephants in deep reverence viewing them as sacred embodiments of Lord Ganesha This spiritual bond has in many ways been the elephants saving grace even amidst threats like electrocution and train collisions Rather than imposing external solutions we honour these beliefs recognizing that conservation must align with their cultural identity By respecting their traditions we show that protecting elephants is not just about wildlifeits about preserving something deeply woven into their heritage This approach has been vital in fostering trust and ensuring the communities embrace conservation as part of their own story rather than something imposed from the outside Q IN YOUR WORK HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE POWER OF SCIENCE AND EXPLORATIONWITH THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION Balancing science with storytelling is at the core of my work As a biologist and communicator I see the beauty in both science gives us the facts the evidence and the urgency while storytelling breathes life into those facts making them relatable and impactful My background in biology helps me grasp the intricacies of elephant behaviour and ecosystem dynamics and my training in environmental education and broadcast journalism allows me to translate those complexities into narratives that resonate Films are a perfect medium for thisthrough powerful visuals and emotional storytelling I can take the raw data and transform it into something people not only understand but feel deeply connected to By blending the precision of science with the emotional pull of storytelling we can inspire people to care engage and ultimately act on behalf of conservation Its about making the science accessible and also unforgettable Q COULD YOU DISCUSS A SPECIFIC PROJECT WHERE YOU SUCCESSFULLY USED STORYTELLING TO ENGAGE AND EDUCATE BOTH LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND GLOBAL AUDIENCES Deadly Tracks part of the Asian Elephants 101 series had a profound impact on both local communities and global audiences The film exposed the heartbreaking loss of elephants killed on train tracks moving even local farmerswho once saw elephants as crop destroyersto tears Similarly Treacherous Crossings shed light on the tragic deaths of elephants electrocuted by sagging power lines stirring deep empathy These stories resonated because they brought the raw reality of these tragedies to life making people care act and demand change Through storytelling we are transforming anger and apathy into compassion and action bothlocally and globally Q WHAT ARE YOUR FUTURE GOALS FOR CONSERVATION IN INDIA We are excited to launch lifesized robotic elephants in temples replacing live elephants to preserve cultural traditions without harming animals Not a single Hindu or Buddhist tradition promotes the exploitation of elephants so this initiative aligns with their values We are also expanding our EleSense technology which has already averted 1000 train collisions with elephants In 2025 we plan to launch a largescale project to purchase land and plant elephantfriendly saplings fostering peaceful coexistence between people and elephants These efforts will ensure that conservation continues to evolve in innovative sustainable ways Our future vision is rooted in compassion and innovation We are set to introduce life sized robotic elephants to replace LIVE elephants in temples offering a way to honour cultural traditions without causing them harm No Hindu or Buddhist teaching condones the suffering of elephants and this initiative beautifully aligns with their core values of reverence and kindness Were also expanding our groundbreaking EleSense technology that has averted hundreds of tragedies and prevented over 1000 train collisions with elephants Looking ahead to 2025 were embarking on a transformative projectpurchasing land and planting elephantfriendly saplings creating safe havens where elephants and people can coexist in harmony These arent just conservation effortstheyre a promise A promise to leave behind a legacy of compassion innovation and a

in Shackles About the Book The Team Participants Videos Get Involved Host an Elephant Circle Event Volunteer Host a Screening Events Contact Food and Water for Odishas Distraught Elephants Sangita Iyer Oct 22 2024 3 min read Updated Dec 2 2024 The problem Odishas forests once lush sanctuaries for elephants are now vanishing under the relentless pressures of development leaving these gentle giants with nowhere to turn Starving and desperate elephants are forced to risk their lives crossing treacherous highways seeking food and water in villages and croplands This tragic plight is intensifying humanelephant conflicts with lives lost on both sides The 2024 Winter Elephant Census as reported by EBharat and The Hindu paints a heartwrenching picture Odisha is home to 2103 elephants across 38 divisions but in just six months only five births were recordedan unbearable contrast to the 48 deaths in the same timeframe Over the past decade 790 elephants have perished in Odisha with electrocution leading as the primary cause of these unnatural deaths In this time conflicts have claimed 668 human lives and left 509 others injured underscoring the shared tragedy of this crisis To stem this tide of devastation we VFAE has been working 247 with local communities Restoring degraded habitats by planting elephantfriendly vegetation and creating waterholes in their home ranges is offering a lifeline These measures could prevent them from venturing into perilous human landscapes saving them from the heartbreak of untimely deaths and preserving their legacy for generations to come The Solution VFAE has planted 50300 elephant friendly saplings and created eight large waterholes at the trijunction of Balasore Baripada and Hardgarh in Odisha that serves as a critical habitat for elephants The site is frequented by a herd of elephants indicating that it holds significance for them During the construction of waterholes elephants continued to visit the area leaving behind their footprints This trijunction likely boasts diverse ecological features including a wide variety of vegetation and topography contributing to the rich biodiversity and abundance of resources making it an attractive habitat for elephants VFAE partnered with Paribartan India to implement this critical project Meanwhile the ground is being prepared to plant approximately 20000 saplings in the Pallahara and Balasore range for them to blossom during the 2023 rainy season expected by midJuly Thanks to our generous donors for their ongoing support to help us provide basic survival needs to these beleaguered elephants As the harsh summer envelops vast regions of India with temperatures soaring up to 45 degrees Celsius or 113 Fahrenheit water sources are drying up pushing elephants out of the forests and into the villages intensifying human elephant conflict and leading to tragedies By providing enough food and water resources inside the forests elephants will hopefully remain inside the forests More than 80 of elephant habitats have been lost to reckless development to sustain humans with the population in India at 141 billion as of this year surpassing China and earning the top spot for an overcrowded country In 2022 VFAE partnered with the Wildlife Protection Society of India WPSI to grow and transplant thousands of elephantfriendly saplings in an elephant habitat adjacent to an existing corridor aiming to ensure a safe passage for Odisha elephants and create a forest rich in biodiversity A total of 11000 seedlings were reared and 90 have survived in their transplanted locations As forest resources in Odisha rapidly dwindle due to development pressures distressed and famished elephants are forced to enter villages and cropland in search of food by crossing major highways This is intensifying human elephant conflict and causing an unprecedented number of elephant deaths by vehicle collisions Restoring degraded habitats with favored elephant plant species will provide safe foraging grounds for elephants and prevent them from crossing treacherous roads to find food Humanelephant conflict is escalating in Dhenkanal district with an alarming rise in senseless tragedies mainly caused by the decimation of prime elephant habitats and a decline in elephant forage species Consequently distressed elephants are forced to cross national highways and villages in search of food leading to fatal collisions with speeding vehicles Some of the factors fuelling the destruction include development tree felling for timber and nontimber products collection for humans Part of the plan involves the purchase of a 1acreplot of land to create a plant nursery and grow 50000 to 60000 seedlings of elephant fodder plants such as Bauhinia vines jackfruit and mango Our sitespecific strategy in the Dhenkanal region of Odisha will enable us to nurture and protect saplings from cattle grazing and fire damage for at least two growing seasons Once the plants mature we will engage Odisha forest department and local people to plant them in the surrounding forests Curbing elephant deaths by growing elephant fodder and planting them inside their habitats could prevent elephants from crossing treacherous highways It is a proactive rather than a reactive measure to safeguard elephants and mitigate humanelephant conflict In collaboration with our local partner Wildlife Protection Society of India WPSI we will engage villagers and the forest department to help cultivate stewardship of elephants and their habitats paving the way to a harmonious coexistence

technology and restoring hope for their future Sangita Iyer Oct 21 2024 8 min read National Geographic Explorer Sangita Iyer reveals how AI and robotics can transform the future of elephant conservation Click the image to read the full article What if we could solve the endangered elephant crisis with cuttingedge robotic technology National Geographic Explorer Sangita Iyer is on a groundbreaking mission to protect these majestic species by introducing robotic elephants as a humane alternative to captive ones used in religious spaces and festivals In India elephants are revered as gods and they hold significant importance to the cultural culture and religious practices of the country Iyer hopes the use of robotic elephants will revolutionize temple ceremonies and protect endangered Asian elephants from exploitation Iyer has devoted her life to conserving the less than 40000 Asian elephants left in the wild Learn more below about her important work using technology AI and robotics to transform elephant conservation in our exclusive interview What inspired your focus on Asian elephants that led you to dedicate your life to their conservation SANGITA IYER As a child my grandparents used to take me to our family temple where there was a bull elephant They would leave me next to him while they worshiped trusting Id be safe with this majestic animal When I became a teenager my grandma shared that as a 5 year old I once asked her why the elephant had shackles and I didnt My smart grandma got me a pair of silver anklets but that didnt satisfy me I probed why the elephant couldnt move while I could walk freely My grandmother was left speechless It seems my destiny was carved out at that tender age In 2013 a chain of events led me back to Keralas temples I was devastated witnessing the horrific mistreatment of elephantsmany were blind with tears flowing shackles cutting their flesh paraded beneath the scorching sun deprived of food water and shelter As a videographer I began filming voraciously and ended up producing Gods in Shackles I subsequently created a nonprofit Voices for Asian Elephants VFAEto implement projects on the ground now saving hundreds of elephants across three elephantrange states in India In order to address some of the threats to Asian elephant populations you have proposed creating robotic elephants to replace live ones held in captivity Tell us about this initiative how did you launch and lead development of this innovation and what are your plans for deploying these technological marvels across Asia IYER The concept of robotic elephants emerged from the urgent need to end the suffering of captive elephants used in cultural festivals Witnessing the physical and psychological toll on these majestic creatures we envisioned a humane alternative Our creative process began with brainstorming sessions involving engineers wildlife experts and cultural anthropologists We aimed to create lifelike autonomous robotic elephants that could mimic the appearance and movements of real elephants The development journey started with extensive research on elephant physiology and behavior followed by the design phase focused on creating a prototype that was both realistic and functional We collaborated with robotics experts based in Kerala to integrate advanced AI and motion technology ensuring the robots could interact safely and naturally with people Leading this innovation required assembling a multidisciplinary team securing funding and navigating bureaucracies We launched our first robotic elephant at a Gudalur temple in Tamil Nadu to ensure cultural acceptance The project was so well received that other temples are contacting us as we get ready to launch our next robotic elephant in early 2025 Our plans for deployment include connecting with stakeholders across Asia and providing them with an ethical and sustainable alternative to live elephants Named Siva Sankara Hariharan the first robotic elephant was officially unveiled during the Sivarathri festival in March 2024 Video by Voices for Asian Elephants With the introduction of the robotic elephant how do you simultaneously manage to preserve cultural heritage and alleviate elephant suffering IYER VFAEs pioneering initiative could help reduce the alarming number of captive elephant deaths an average of 25 of them and numerous handlers are killed every year In 2023 alone there were 293 cases of stampedes in Kerala caused by festival elephants running amok unable to walk on melting tar roads and the cacophony of noises including fireworks Four elephant handlers were killed and 26 festival revelers injured posing a serious public safety threat According to media reports the captive elephant population has dropped from around 500 in 2019 to 397 as of the current date with three fatalities occurring in January 2024 a significant decline in just four years The robotic elephants created to appear lifelike present a humane alternative that not only alleviates the suffering of elephants but also mitigates the risks faced by their caretakers As part of the initiative Voices for Asian Elephants is committed to expanding the use of robotic elephants as many temples are acknowledging that using live elephants is not only unconducive to the wellbeing of these majestic creatures but is also a serious public safety threat and too expensive What kind of resources and time does it take to make these lifelike robotic elephants IYER Designing a robotic elephant costs between 15000 to 25000 covering fiber optics materials design transportation and traditional ornaments The design process outsourced to a skilled Keralabased artist known for creating various animal mascots involves intricate craftsmanship and attention to detail to ensure lifelike replicas Developing these robotic marvels requires substantial resources and time Each elephant takes about six months to complete from initial design to final assembly The process starts with detailed research on elephant physiology and movement to create a realistic and humane alternative Engineers and artists collaborate to integrate advanced robotics AI and motion technology We source highquality materials to construct durable and lifelike structures The production phase involves meticulous assembly and rigorous testing to ensure safety and functionality Traditional ornaments and cultural elements are added to maintain authenticity and respect for cultural traditions Additionally significant investment in RD skilled labor and logistical support is essential Our goal is to deploy these robotic elephants across cultural festivals in Asia promoting animal welfare while preserving cultural heritage This innovative approach demonstrates that technology and compassion can coexist offering a sustainable alternative to the exploitation of live elephants This AIbased robotic elephant can flap its ears move its eyes and spray water on temple devotees using its trunk Video by Voices for Asian Elephants What is your vision for the future of robotic elephants at Voices for Asian Elephants IYER At VFAE our vision is to fully replace live elephants with robotic counterparts in cultural festivals across Asia allowing these majestic creatures to remain in their natural habitats This transition though challenging and gradual is crucial for elephant welfare and cultural preservation The deeply ingrained cultural beliefs surrounding live elephants have existed for generations if not centuries Changing these practices would require time patience and persistence We acknowledge that this shift could potentially take decades as altering such longstanding norms involves educating communities and gaining the trust and support of religious and cultural leaders We actively collaborate with religious institutions and businesses to facilitate this transition Engaging with religious leaders helps raise awareness about the ethical implications of using live elephants and the benefits of adopting robotic alternatives Partnering with businesses secures funding and sponsorships ensuring financial sustainability for creating and deploying robotic elephants and supporting the rehabilitation of live elephants Additionally we pursue community outreach programs educational campaigns and advocacy efforts to build broad support Our goal is to foster a compassionate future where elephants thrive in the wild free from exploitation while cultural traditions are preserved in a humane and sustainable manner What do you think are some of the most remarkable qualities and wonders of elephants for someone unfamiliar with them IYER Elephants are intelligent and social animals who thrive in a matriarchal culture and complex social structures Just like humans elephants fiercely protect the young with allomothers aunts and nannies nurturing them Bull elephants disperse from the herd between 10 and 15 years of age They were thought to be solitary however recent studies show that bull Asian elephants form bachelor groups so they can navigate safely through the everchanging landscapes I believe elephants are Divine Masters who have arrived on the planet to teach humans how to coexist harmoniously They create pathways to waterholes and food resources that other animals would be otherwise unable to retrieve Elephants are the living expression of empathy In fact the word ELEPHANT has a profound meaning as it weaves together the supremely divine traits of E mpathy L ove E ndurance P atience H umility A wareness N urturance and T eamwork Consider scientific knowledge available on elephants that highlights their critical role in mitigating climate change such as promoting the growth of hardwood trees that sequester much more carbon than softwood trees benefiting many species including humans It is crucial to embrace a path that reveres and protects these sacred animals who serve a grander purpose in the wild than in captivity Elephants pass through the rows of a tea estate in Valparai Tamil Nadu India Photograph by Brent StirtonNational Geographic Specifically on Asian elephants can you describe the current landscape of elephant captivity IYER Nearly one in three Asian elephants lives in captivityaround 15000 in totalexploited by the logging and tourism industries across Asia In India about onethird of the approximately 2700 captive elephants are abused by religious institutions The southern Indian state of Kerala the most notorious holds the largest number of captive bull elephants which are critically endangered Young bulls are captured in the northern states of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam torn from their herd and transported to Kerala Using inhumane training methods involving several days of starvation beating and prodding with brutal bull hooks with pointed metal tips they are tortured into submission Elephants are revered as the embodiment of Lord Ganesh a Hindu God with an elephant face Yet in a tragic irony these sacred beings are abused and exploited for profit in the name of culture and religion despite no scriptures promoting such practices The socalled traditions are driven by greed Elephant owners lease out their elephants to temples through brokers while temples receive large donations from devotees to parade elephants Everyone benefits except the elephants who generate millions of dollars while enduring unimaginable trauma This heartbreaking cycle of exploitation must end As a call to action what are the most crucial steps individuals can take to protect and conserve Asian elephants IYER Protecting and conserving Asian elephants is a mission that requires the collective effort of compassionate individuals Here are a few crucial steps everyone can take Educate Yourself and Others Understanding and sharing the knowledge regarding the plight of captive Asian elephants and the significant role of wild elephants as climate mitigators in the ecosystem is the first step to raising awareness Support Ethical Tourism By visiting sanctuaries and reserves that prioritize the

profound insights on how we can use the lessons learned from the pandemic to move forward in a more mindful way inclusive of the environment and all beings on the planet Dr Jane Goodall DBE Founder the Jane Goodall Institute Day 2 Sunday November 8th was Elepalooza a virtual concert hosted by poet animal activist Sean Hill who balanced his whimsical energy with Sangita Iyer s expertise as they discussed the importance of saving endangered Asian elephants particularly in India where the 60 of the worlds wild Asian elephants precariously coexist in one of the most densely humanpopulated countries Written produced and directed by Maureen Mahon Elepalooza featured musical performances by Grammywinning artists Colin Hay Lisa Loeb Tia Carrere as well as Cecilia Noel Victoria Summer Libby Lavella Steve Wood and Beth Fitchet Wood Donald Quan and eaoh Argos Dyna Shirasaki and Carlos Villalobos CUSH Muddy Elephant Lila Rose fka Aniiml Holly Henderson Wendell Shine Hayward WonderBOOM and BlVd HVnny Interspersed between musical performances were informative clips about the importance of elephants to the Earths ecosystem by notable personalities including Lori Alan who explained how elephants are the gardeners of the earth Fia Perera emphasized that elephants are keystone species and that all of our survival relies on the survival of elephants Mark Thompson discussed how elephants help mitigate climate change Kelly King compared taking a baby elephant from its mother to kidnapping one of our own babies and subjecting it to a life of slavery and Nick Jaine explained how the COVID 19 pandemic has exacerbated human elephant conflict in the region and how VFAES is not only helping save elephants lives but also creating jobs for the people of Odisha Sangita Iyers short segment entitled Hollywood Voices for the Forgotten Elephants of Odisha featured celebrities above Kate Linder William Shatner Ken Davitian Wedil David and the Late Garry Marshall who shared their personal insights about these amazing animals encouraging viewers to donate to this important cause A highlight of the show was a special performance by speedpainter Amy Burkman who dazzled us with an original 30x40 acrylic painting in less than 10 minutes She later surprised us with a second painting depicting Sangita Iyer with her beloved Lakshmi a captive temple in Kerala who was poignantly featured in Sangitas epic documentary Gods in Shackles Amy dedicated the beautiful painting to Iyer bringing her to tears In addition to auctioning off the original paintings high quality signed and certified limitededition prints were offered to the highest bidders So many people contributed their time and talents to the production of Elepalooza including creative team Caden Douglas PJ Koelbel John Hays and Nitin Koshy Samuel and Paula Tiso who lent her voice for the opening credits And the overall success of the weekend would have been impossible without the support of Dan Richardson Symity Ltd Loreen LaPenna Melinda Pharr Shana Kelly Jennifer Hebden and other volunteers who dedicated their time and talent to a worthy cause One point that Sangita and Sean discussed which really resonated with me is that we cannot turn away from the suffering of animals merely because it makes us uncomfortable We need to meet the issues headon if we are to make this world a better place We can all do our part by sharing on social media volunteering donating and taking action Our elephants are the true gardeners of this planet and we need to protect them and their home Now is the time for us to ACT About the Forgotten Elephants of Odisha We call this event The Forgotten Elephants of Odisha because theyve indeed been forgotten Most of the attention has been focused on the southern Indian states as they have the highest concentration of elephants However this is the first time the voices of Odishas elephants are being amplified In the elephant range state of Odisha fragmented forests arduously support an estimated 2000 wild Asian elephants along with a growing number of people dependent on forest resources There are approximately 45 million people in Odisha many living along the forest fringes and corridors that elephants have established over thousands of years The inevitable encounters with elephants lead to conflict and an alarming number of deaths as elephants and humans struggle for limited resources When the COVID19 lockdown hit India millions of migrant workers lost their jobs These villagers mostly farmers traveled to cities for parttime work to supplement the meager earnings during the harvest season Now most people are all stuck at home unemployed and stressed worried that elephants will destroy whatever is left of their livelihood and crops And they are taking matters into their own hands The increased anxiety and economic pressure resulting from the COVID19 pandemic has been like tossing a match on tinder making an already dire situation for the elephants even more perilous At least onethird of the more than 60 elephants killed in India during the COVID lockdown is from Odisha state a graveyard for elephants Most of them have been killed by electrocution poisoning and poaching for the illicit ivory trade Developmental activities such as illegal mining in prime habitats highly invasive and poorly planned infrastructure land diversions and even forest fires add to the friction as they cause irreversible damage to this elephant landscape Furthermore rampant poaching by local gangs has a direct impact on the breeding populations of elephants in the region as they target the bull elephants with tusks VFAES has partnered with a grassroots organization Wildlife Protection Society of India WPSI to bring an end to this insanity VFAES and WPSI will lead a team of local conservationists to steer knowledgedriven elephant conservation actions in some of the most vulnerable regions of the state Over the long term our aim is to secure a future for Odishas forgotten elephants by promoting a harmonious and respectful human elephant coexistence VFAES will use the funds raised through this event to save 2000 wild elephants by hiring the native people to monitor and implement the following strategies Prevent electrocution by wire traps and electrified fences Monitor eight important corridors out of the 14 identified Monitor and address multiple threats to elephants in key habitats in Dhenkanal Angul Keonjhar districts Fodder planting in the TaalKholagarh Elephant Corridor Protect elephant habitat from forest fires Awareness and education for school children and key stakeholders Engage local communities Despite the unprecedented challenges Odisha still offers perhaps the best chance of securing a future for Asian elephants in Eastern India India AsianElephants SangitaIyer elephants Wildlife JaneGoodall KateLinder LisaLoeb TiaCarrere WilliamShatner WedilDavid virtual ColinHay

Iyer Jan 23 2024 3 min read Updated Feb 11 2024 The risks of a highly interconnected world Interconnected globalised borderless That is how our world looks today a microcosm in which how a single state behaves can have unimagined and significant consequences on the rest of the planet From an allencompassing approach this interdependence becomes salient when combating wildlife loss promoting biodiversity preservation and fostering the protection of megaherbivores due to how state policies ranging from land use and deforestation policies to wildlife trafficking and conservation deregulation can directly mould global ecosystems and their management Land use policies at the service of the common good or global destruction Economy over conservation Sadly this is the national motto that prevails in decisionmaking settings and policy enforcement dynamics This prioritisation has fostered the development of state land use policies that directly harm the ecosystem by promoting the expansion of agriculture and logging projects at the expense of destroying the habitats of several species Particularly Malaysias land use policies have destined huge areas of their forests in Borneo to palm oil plantations an economically enriching national strategy that has not only transformed the Malaysian landscapes but it has also reduced fragmented and irreversibly damaged the natural habitat of all kinds of communities that have been forced to emigrate elsewhere A similar situation is being faced in Brazil where deforestation policies which have led to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest have reduced local biodiversity threatened wildlife preservation initiatives and likewise fostered their displacement Amazon deforestation Source Getty Images Alan Chaves Focusing on Malaysia the Borneos Asian elephant is one of the key species directly affected by these land use policies as the massive grasslands they need to live comfortably are being used for palm oil production Sadly instead of picturing the Asian elephant as the innocent victim of habitat loss these megaherbivores get poisoned or even killed because of having damaged the same palm oil plantations that have turned their habitats into manmade areas of agricultural exploitation These nonsensical accusations have intensified the elephantfarmer conflicts and likewise strengthened the enforcement of more strict land use policies at the expense of displacing and killing these majestic species perpetuating habitat destruction practices Palmoil survivors by Aaron Bertie Gekoski Unfortunately what might initially be considered an isolated and nationally delimited circumstance can end up having direct and indirect international repercussions as wildlife loss and biodiversity threats affect general ecosystemic dynamics Specifically Malaysian palm oil policies and Brazilian deforestation by forcing species displacement have destabilised and disrupted other ecological niches and biodiversity patterns around the world And not only that Asian elephants have a dual role as the gardeners of the planet due to seed dispersion and air pollution mitigators because of how the disseminated seeds can turn into trees that trap carbon dioxide showing how harming and killing these megaherbivores by enforcing said policies has global and borderless effects beyond local consequences National deregulation at the expense of animal exploitation Not only the presence but also the lack of effective national policies that protect endangered species from trafficking organisations and international webs of distribution poses a threat to wildlife and biodiversity preservation Poaching and trade of ivory and horns have become Elephants and Rhinos worst nightmare deregulated practices in Africa and Asia that have not only produced a gender imbalance among these species but they have also conditioned their gene pool ecological and sexual selection and longterm survival Moreover this biological trend and their decline has likewise impacted other species that rely on the ecosystemic role elephants and rhinos play Source Freeland by Siwaporn T Sadly the list of species around the world that find themselves unprotected by effective state policies is endless The pangolin found in Indonesia Vietnam and Laos gets trafficked and traded on a daily basis due to a high demand from traditional medicine and pet markets a similar trend found in Thailand and Laos where different body parts of tigers are likewise used for traditional medicine purposes and in Madagascar with lemurs where they are trafficked as exotic pets By taking into consideration how the pangolin plays a pivotal role in insect control how the tiger by being a top predator in the ecological pyramid is involved in natural population control and how the lemur is a seed disperser and pollinator their decline impacts the correct functioning of diverse ecosystems disrupts borderless ecological patterns and threatens biodiversity preservation strategies Sources a WCS Paul Hilton b National Geography image collection Vincent J Musi Interconnectedness a bliss or our source of misery Action is required if these states do not put forward conservationoriented policies these major ecological imbalances will not stop compromising the interconnected globalised and
