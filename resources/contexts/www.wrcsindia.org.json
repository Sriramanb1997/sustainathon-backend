Remains from Owl Pellets in Central India By Prachi Mehta Shyamkant Talmale Jayant Kulkarni and Vaishnavi Kulkarni Owls are some of the most specialised avian predators in the world Their powerful vision strong talons and silent flight makes them highly accomplished predators Owls are versatile hunters and feed on a variety of live prey including small mammals reptiles birds amphibians and invertebrates Owls consume their prey whole and eject the undigested parts such as fur feather claws talons and invertebrate exoskeleton in the form of a pellet The regurgitated pellet offers valuable information on the foraging ecology of the owls Identification of various prey items provides insights into dietary habits of owls It can provide information on regional and seasonal variation in owl diet Most usefully it can provide information on differences in diet composition between species In this manual we provide systematic keys to identify prey remains of small mammals birds reptiles amphibians and invertebrates commonly found in the regurgitated pellets of owls The manual provides photographic identification keys to five prey taxa commonly found in owl pellets This is the first manual of its kind in India An early version of this manual was released in the World Owl Conference held at Pune in December 2019 The manual includes forewords by wellknown owl ecologists Dr David Johnson and Dr Bruce Marcot and has been meticulously reviewed by Dr James Duncan We are hopeful that this manual will prove to be a useful resource for researchers studying the diet of raptors and small carnivores in Central India Please click on the button below if you want a copy of the book After submitting the Google form you will be taken to a link where you can download the PDF file of

proximity of elephant landscapes face daily challenges in terms of protecting their crops from elephants Elephants find agricultural crops irresistible No wonder that farmers find it difficult to keep elephants away from their crop fields To cope with this problem farmers elephant scientists and wildlife managers in Asia and Africa have come up with a variety of techniques to keep the giant at bay These solutions range from simple commonsense solutions to those using advanced technology This book describes in simple terms a wide range of techniques and solutions that people have come up with to protect agricultural crops from elephants Each section describes one technique We have also pointed out the pros and cons of each technique so that you can make an informed decision on which one you should use The last two chapters are devoted to more general elephant management issues We hope this book makes it easier for people and elephants to live together in the same landscape Please click

into habitat patterns of forestdwelling mammals in the buffer zone of Melghat Tiger Reserve India By Pavan Chikkanarayanaswamy Jayant Kulkarni Prasad Pathak Buffer zones surrounding protected areas act as interfaces between humans and wildlife providing sustainable resource utilization while minimizing negative interactions This study analyzed data from camera trap sampling to understand habitat use and the effects of anthropogenic impacts on medium and largesized forestdwelling mammals in the buffer zone of Melghat Tiger Reserve in Central India The human population in this region is increasing at a rate of 15 in a decade There are instances of human death and injury and frequent cattle lifting by carnivores Crop damage by wild herbivores is common These factors impede long term conservation goals in the tiger reserve Camera trap sampling was carried out in the buffer zone for a period of 33 to 46 days Camera trap data were analyzed using occupancy modeling to estimate habitat use probability \u03a8 and detection probability p Na\u00efve estimates of habitat use ranged from 011 to 064 while \u03a8 values based on occupancy modeling ranged from 023 to 071 The study showed a fairly high level of habitat use by mammals in the buffer zone of the tiger reserve Leopards were found to be associated with abundance of large prey species and human presence Hyena gaur and sambar showed an association with forest cover while nilgai showed association with scrubland Chausingha and langur showed an association with sloping terrain Overall the study showed that the buffer zone plays an important role as a wildlife habitat and provided insights for prioritizing conservation efforts and management strategies in the study area Download Wildlife Research and Conservation

located in Satpura Hill Ranges in Amravati District on border with Madhya Pradesh State Melghat was declared a tiger reserve in 1974 and is one of the first nine tiger reserves in India under Project Tiger of the Government of India It is the largest tiger reserve in the Maharashtra At present it has an area of 2768 km2 which includes 1550 sq km core and 1268 sq km buffer Being part of the Satpuda hill ranges Melghat has a very hilly and picturesque terrain The forests of Melghat are of the type Central Indian dry teakbearing forests At one time Melghat was managed as for production of timber from teak and for bamboo and timber from Melghat was considered to be of high quality With the formation of Melghat Tiger Reserve timber production is only carried out in smaller quantities in the buffer zone The tiger is the flagship species of Melghat The cameras trapping exercise carried out by the Forest Department and WRCS in 2016 puts the minimum tiger population at 60 tigers Melghat harbours a rich assemblage of wildlife found in Central India including other large carnivores such as the leopard dhole sloth bear and hyena and large herbivores sambar chital muntjac four horned antelope and nilgai Other large mammal species found in Melghat include jungle cat langur rhesus macaque honey badger ratel palm civet small Indian civet grey mongoose and Indian porcupine Melghat is

in Melghat Other communities include the Gawli community the Gond tribe and several other smaller tribal communities Tiger Conservation Project by WRCS WRCS is carrying out a project for conservation of the magnificent tiger in the wonderful terrain of Melghat since 2012 WRCS is implementing the project in the core and the buffer zone of the tiger reserve The tiger conservation project in Melghat has a strong component of community involvement and is based on scientific monitoring of the tiger and other wildlife The project is being carried out in close coordination with the Forest Department The main components of the project are described below Camera trap monitoring of the tiger Camera trap monitoring of the tiger population was carried out in 2014 and 2015 in the buffer zone of the tiger reserve Cameras were deployed in all forested parts of the buffer zone In both years nine tigers were recorded in the buffer zone indicating the high potential of the buffer for tiger conservation With more protection to wildlife and the habitat the buffer zone has the capacity to support more tigers WRCS has recently started a joint initiative for concurrent monitoring of tiger presence by establishing pressure impression pads PIP along known trails of the tiger in the buffer zone Sustainability The communitys dependence on the forest for firewood timber and NTFP exerts strong degrading pressure on the habitat WRCS is working for sustainable utilization of the forest resources so that the habitat is conserved while fulfilling the needs of the community smokeless firewood stoves A workshop was conducted for implementation of fuelefficient chulha An analysis was conducted of various models of smokeless chulhas to determine which are more fuelefficient and which are have better acceptability In the next year WRCS will implement the smokeless chulhas in several villages in Melghat Fire is a major cause for degradation of Melghats forests Fire is either lit deliberately or happens while clearing the undergrowth for collection of mahua flowers in summer WRCS is educating the community to avoid fire by careful control of fire in the mahua season Livelihood Lack of livelihood opportunities is a major issue for forestdwelling communities It forces them to migrate outside for jobs or indulge in illicit activities WRCS is implementing various activities to generate livelihood for the community Training in bamboo craft is being imparted to youths to provide income from sale of bamboo articles WRCS will help to market the articles made by the youths The community is being trained to make baskets from PP strapping tapes This is a very strong material so the baskets produced are strong and durable The community members have responded very enthusiastically to the training and it is helping to provide them livelihood in the villages WRCS is helping to market the bags Education WRCS is implementing a twoyear environmental education program in ashram shalas residential schools in Melghat in partnership with WWF Students of standards 6th to 9th will be educated through this program Environmentally aware students will help to conserve this region in the longterm Partners and Supporters The project is being carried out in partnership with the Tiger Reserve authorities in the Core Zone and the territorial Forest Department in buffer zone WWFIndia has been a partner in the Melghat project and has provided financial support from the beginning WWFIndia is also a partner in the environmental education program US Fish and Wildlife Service is supporting the project for cameratrap monitoring of the tiger WRCS is part of a consortium with the Forest Department as the main partner that is recipient of a grant for tiger

Ecological Restoration A Need Of The Hour Anuja Vartak Dec 27 2020 3 min read Image source Google Images The ability to constantly adapt to changing environments is the primary reason that singlecelled and multicellular organisms have been able to survive on this planet for years Despite continuous changes that take place within an ecosystem it continues to thrive and adapt independently as long as the changes depend on environmental factors But once human intervention occurs independent survival becomes nearly impossible The extinction of species is estimated to have increased between 1000 and 10000 times the normal rate after human intervention While the obvious reason for habitat loss is rapid urbanisation and rising demands the reasons for changing landscapes arent so obvious There is a common misconception that everything green around us is always healthy In the process of turning the lands green selfsustaining habitats are transformed into completely unrecognisable sites Considering marshlands and grasslands as wastelands and planting tall trees to increase green cover have disturbed the existing biodiversity of the area ruining completely healthy ecosystems Most of the times during tree plantation drives hardy plants are planted on the site It is a common trend that these plants happen to be invasive which is why they can adapt and grow even in adverse conditions But in the process of thriving these plants outnumber the native floral diversity taking a heavy toll on the existing fauna as well Thus the ecosystem is dramatically upturned also adversely affecting the ecosystem services that we humans often derive Identifying plants that historically existed in such lands and replanting them has become one of the vital steps to save these lands The process involving such activities that attempt restoring degraded ecosystems is known as ecological restoration and the study which goes behind practising this method is called restoration ecology Before starting an ecological restoration project clear objectives need to be set and a reference site with a healthy ecosystem having similar environmental conditions is always helpful The main aim of the project in most cases is to bring back the degraded habitat to its original condition But in scenarios where full restoration is not possible ecologists attempt to restore habitats up to a point where they can withstand stresses even without human intervention At times the entire land is cleared and left for vegetation to reestablish with zero human interference and the term for it is secondary succession Whatever the method it is necessary to pinpoint the exact cause of site degradation rather than just treating the symptoms to ensure that the earlier problems do not persist and a conservative approach of repairing the damaged is taken as against complete replacement Let us take the example of Pune city Pune since historical times has never fallen into the category of the area under dense evergreen vegetation But due to lack of awareness in the year 1990 Gliricidia sepium which is a fastgrowing hardy tree was planted all over the socalled barren slopes of hillocks tekdi to increase green cover and to protect the land from land grabbers Over the years the species outnumbered the native plant populations thus heavily damaging the existing ecosystems and creating novel ecosystems all over the city Today nearly 50 hectares of land is being cleared of the species Gliricidia sepium has a property of allelopathy ie it secretes certain chemicals which do not allow any vegetation to grow around it and also turns the soil acidic Apart from the negatives the leguminous tree helps to fix nitrogen in the soil Thus now suddenly removing the tree species could in fact worsen the situation This is why the forest department has taken up an ecological restoration project where after a detailed study nitrogenfixing native trees which can survive in acidic soil and dry conditions will be planted Historical records are being used while planning the project The department hopes to retrieve at least some of the lost biodiversity of Pune through the process of ecorestoration Nature has always optimized its resources and humans have never left a chance to exploit them In the greed for more we have not only overutilised the resources but have also unnecessarily interfered in natures cycle of selfhealing Although today with indepth studies attempts are being made to reverse the damage there is only little that ecologists can do But let us together preserve the existing intact habitats by planting trees only after consulting experts instead of converting them into novel ecosystems For further insights

This Video Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr Copy Link Link Copied Share Channel Info Close For those of us who are cityliving wildlife enthusiasts each wildlife sighting is memorable and precious Most of us strive for the lifers that perfect click and the target species from our lists But for those who live around forested areas the stories are entirely different They struggle daily to safeguard their lives crops livestock and even property from wild animals Local communities living around elephant forests consider the elephants as nothing but a Giant Pest who is responsible for destroying their lives In retaliation elephants are killed electrocuted and captured In case of tigers they are killed mercilessly for their body parts Poisoning of carcass is commonly used method to kill the tiger Owl is another majestic yet unfortunate species that is suffering because of misguided beliefs Owls are considered to be inauspicious and a bad omen and are therefore captured traded and even killed Apart from wildlife forests are also viewed as a burden for those who want to earn a quick buck Privately owned forests serve as a vital corridor for wildlife but for the owners it is a wasted resource if it not cut and sold Our understanding of the above issues emanates from our longterm work on elephants in Northern Karnataka Tigers in Central Maharashtra Forest Corridors in Western Maharashtra and owls in Central India We realized that unless the local people get monetary benefit from wildlife and forests they are not going to be willing partners in conservation But how do we achieve this If they can earn money through wildlife it may help in reducing their animosity and gradually the tolerance towards their presence may increase We put this premise at work and developed Community Initiative Programs at each of our project sites We developed our focus species elephant tiger owl gaur hornbill bamboo and tree as a craft mascot We designed mascot based products and trained the women in making them The uniqueness of our product is they are handstitched using recycled and upcycled material We are consciously trying to minimize the use of synthetic material and promoting the use of natural material The readied products are marketed by us through various channels The proceeds of the sale is directed towards the communities who make the products The communities earn money which helps in offsetting their losses Encouraged by this the local people participate in project activities and help in species conservation Sounds logical and simple but is a hugely challenging task This initiative is successful only because of you who appreciates purchase and support our products and are most valued customers Please read more about our community initiative stories below Airavat Products Since 2009 we are working with elephants and local people in North Kanara District of Karnataka We are training the farmers in using simple lowcost measures to protect their crops from elephants so that they do not suffer economic loss Further to offset their losses we are training the women in the villages to make elephantthemed handicraft items Branded under Airavat the mighty elephant of Indra god the women are making headlines with their skill Athena Products Since 2005 we have been working on the distribution and ecology of Forest Owlet and other owls in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra Owls and many other holenesters need cavitytrees for nesting roosting and staying safe The lovely women of our project areas are creating magic with their hands in making owl themed products Marketed under the name of Athena a Greek Goddess of craft and wisdom and also the genus of Spotted and Forest Owlet the products are helping the women to earn an income and in return protect the species and habitat Anjani Products In Western Ghats of Maharashtra there are privately owned forests or malki forests which are owned by villagers These forests serve as vital corridors for wildlife movement in Koyna and Chandoli Forests In order to provide incentive to protect the forests in their farms we are providing incentives to the farmers in livelihood programs Women are being trained in making local cuisine and youth are being trained as ecoguides Additionally women are being trained in handicraft products under Anjani brand Anjani or Memecylon umbellatum is commonly found tree in the area and it fills the forests with its violet bloom making the landscape appear ethereal Our other products on bamboo craft and on the theme of tiger gaur and

Elephants are ready are you Dr Prachi Mehta Achievement More news on elephant project Elephants Ring the bell Shop Blog Cart Conserving Private Forests in KoynaChandoli Corridor Establishing a Model For Sustainability Private Forests Gram Sabha at Bopoli Village BACKGROUND The Western Ghats also known as the Sahyadri is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world and harbours several rare and endangered species of plants and animals M\u0101lki forests forests on private land are extensively found in the Western Ghats Private forests are very important for several ecosystem services such as soil conservation regulation of water flow in rivers prevention of global warming conservation of biodiversity and landscape connectivity They also provide forest produce and income to the owners Read the news on m\u0101lki forests Koyna Sanctuary and Chandoli National Park together constitute the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve The Koyna Chandoli corridor lies between Koyna Sanctuary and Chandoli National Park It is a critical wildlife corridor and also forms part of the buffer zone of Sahyadri Tiger Reserve It sustains extensive private forests along with government forests The area has distinct climatic and geographic conditions which give rise to rich biodiversity Considering its importance as a critical wildlife corridor and the large extent of private forests in this region WRCS is implementing a project for conservation of private forests Some benefits of conserving private forests are Economic benefits to the local community Valuable ecosystem services such as soil conservation regulation of watershed runoff Conservation of biodiversity Strengthening the connectivity of the wildlife corridor The project area consists of 18 villages with a total area of 9300 hectares of which 5200 hectares 55 is under private forests The people in the project area belong to the economically underprivileged section of society Their main occupation is subsistence agriculture At present the private forests are managed unsustainably because of which they are getting degraded There is tremendous potential for conserving the forests and generating economic returns to their owners if the forests are managed sustainably by applying principles of scientific forestry Through this project WRCS is promoting sustainable forest management practices that will yield enhanced forest produce and also conserve the forests The community is encouraged to protect their m\u0101lki forests from tree cutting and fire Tree plantation is carried out since 2014 using native tree species in blank spaces and gaps in the forest The bamboo plantation is being carried out to yield quick income At a later stage they will be trained in scientific forestry practices Incomegenerating activities such as beekeeping and cottage industries are being promoted Beekeeping is being promoted as an activity compatible with private forestry Several training sessions have been conducted through the project We are exploring opportunities for other incomegenerating activities Conservation of M\u0101lki forest in this region will consolidate the corridor between Koyna Sanctuary and Chandoli National Park It will serve as an excellent model for conservation of M\u0101lki forests in the Western Ghats PROJECT AREA Wildlife Research and Conservation Society WRCS has been carrying out a project for the conservation of private forests in 18 villages in corridor region between Koyna Sanctuary and Chandoli National Park The project area is an important wildlife corridor between the two protected areas The extent of the project area is about 9300 ha of which nearly 5200 ha is private forests The project area is a part of the northern Western Ghats which is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world and UNESCO recognized as a world heritage site The area located in the Patan block of Satara district of Maharashtra India PROJECT GOAL The goal of the project is to strengthen the KoynaChandoli corridor by the restoration of private forests and establish a model for sustainable management and utilization of private forests PROJECT ACTIVITIES Ecorestoration Tree plantation and seed sowing Capacity building of women members to make food products and handicrafts Ecotourism Beekeeping Organic Farming Awareness generation Environmental education for students PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS Working with 231 private forests owners from 27 villages of the project area 136000 seedlings planted on 500 acres of degraded private forests achieving over 80 survival rate More than 90000 mandays employment generated in tree plantation activity for the local community 8 Women making handicrafts the total sale around Rs 45 lakh per year Bee Keeping

Celebration 2020 SUPPORT THE PROJECT Incentivebased conservation is a widely practised strategy of offering monetary or inkind incentives to the stakeholders to encourage them to adopt sustainable management practices The incentives are generally low but sufficient to motivate the stakeholders to adopt sustainable management practices Conservation of existing forests by paying incentives is more costeffective than carrying out plantation on degraded land Agreements will be made with the Malki owners to protect forests on their land for a period of at least 5 years Incentives will be paid after appropriate verification We expect that the Malki landowners will become selfreliant after a period of 5 years and manage their forests sustainably without need for incentives Your monetary contributions will help us carry out incentivebased conservation of m\u0101lki forests at Koyna We need your sustained commitment for a period of at least 5 years Your donations will be used to pay incentives cash or kind to malki owners for protection of m\u0101lki forests You can contribute to tree plantation through the Donate a Tree Scheme Please visit the donate page to make donations Please contact us to discuss specific activities to support 5 years old Plantation site at Devghar Bamboo Plant VOLUNTEERING OPPORTUNITY We have opportunities for small groups to volunteer on this project Tree plantations require a steady workforce to maintain saplings remove weeds mulch young trees among other tasks If you are a small group two to four people that is looking for some field time on weekends and are willing to get your hands muddy then contact Sunil at sunilkale25gmailcom Volunteers need to pay for their own travel both ways food expenses and basic accommodation at

OF LIVING with the ELEPHANTS By Prachi Mehta WRCS Feb 23 2018 7 min read Updated Dec 3 2018 Manju was smiling watching his mother Shashikala 53 narrate the following incident with considerable excitement The sound of the song woke us both It was 1 am I thought my mobile was ringing but it was silent and yet the song was playing Just then Manju looked out of the window and yelled out banni banni Aane hegidra Come soon elephant has come I peeped out and saw a huge tusker standing near that banana plant It stood there for a minute and then suddenly turned its back and walked away She added laughingly Maybe it did not like this song It was the first time we could see the elephant so clearly in our farm There was a tinge of amusement in her voice After this incident Manju has installed 2 more alarm bells around his farm in Karkinkoppa village to protect his banana plants from elephants This incident may not sound extraordinary but since I know the history behind this it will remain special to me In 2010 when we began our work on the use of simple low cost methods for reducing crop damage by elephants we met with a lot of resistance from the farmers They advised us on what we ought to be doing to reduce crop loss Most of them wanted us to remove the elephants from the forests many demanded funds for solar fence and elephant proof trench others wanted us to guard their crops every night and a few suggested that we should help them to shift outside the forests In the meetings the farmers would turn up in large numbers to register their grievances against the elephants the Forest Department field staff fellow farmers all other wildlife and their inlaws Amidst this setting we began our work on demonstrating the use of lowcost crop protection methods Some farmers became interested but most others were curious onlookers Manju was one of the interested farmers There are about 60 elephants in Dandeli Anshi Tiger Reserve in North Kanara District of Karnataka state Every year between July to January elephants visit the paddy and sugarcane fields of Yellapur and Haliyal divisions damaging about 300 crop fields During the cropping season there is palpable tension in the air as elephants are out crops are raided farmers are suffering and the Forest Department is under slack for not managing the situation The media is full of reports of farmers woes misbehaviour of elephants and inefficiency of the Forest Department Once I heard an angry farmer yelling at the hapless Forest Guard Last night the elephants came to my field and damaged my crops What were you doing Where were you This statement explained many things to me in an instant In India the responsibility of managing the elephants inside or outside the forests sits squarely on the shoulders of the Forest Department During the cropping season the field staff receives phone calls from the farmers throughout the night asking them to chase away the elephants from their fields The task becomes challenging when there are thousands of crops fields abutting the forests growing paddy sugarcane banana coconut maize finger millet and other crops that elephant find hard to resist and less than 100 field staff to drive them away By the time the field staff reaches the venue substantial crop loss has taken place Forest Department offers compensation for the loss but often that is not enough to redress the damages Forest Department installs solar fences and makes elephant proof trenches to prevent elephant entry in the fields but these measures offer short term respite as elephants often breach them Also the fences and trenches become defunct in 1 or 2 years due to lack of maintenance From 2004 to 2009 while working on humanelephant conflict in Kodagu District in Karnatana and KolhapurSindhudurg districts in Maharashtra we realised that farmers perceive elephants as an enemy only when they suffer economic losses At other times they do not object to the presence of elephants in their landscape Unless the reasons for their grouse are addressed it is difficult to conserve the elephants in humandominated landscape In 2010 we initiated a pilot project with the support of CEPFATREEs Western Ghats Program to implement the concept of communitybased management of elephant conflict CBCM wherein the farmers are trained in protecting their own crops using simple lowcost methods Successful implementation of such a project requires longterm presence in the area for hand holding and motivating the farmers to adopt these methods From 2011 onward this work has been continuously supported by the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund of the US Fish and Wildlife Service due to which we are able to implement the CBCM approach on a larger scale and motivate more than 300 farmers to participate in the project activities Our project focused on reviving the practice of self guarding by farmers using many old and a few new methods The tradition of crop guarding is not new to the farmers but for several reasons it is not being followed commonly as it used to be earlier There is considerable fear about elephants which is partly justified Guarding the fields at night after a hard days work is easier said than done To address this issue we are encouraging the farmers to make a spacious and comfortable machan on a tall tree in their field so at least 2 people can stay up on the machan Elephants usually come to raid the fields when it is dark so we suggested use of trip alarm bell The trip alarm is a simple device wherein the boundary of the crop field is secured with a nylon rope and a door bell When the elephant tries to enter the field the rope gets pulled triggering the loud music from the bell The sound of the bell is meant to give an early warning to the farmers about presence of elephant so they can take timely action to chase them out The trip alarm is very useful in early detection of elephants and over 300 farmers have installed trip alarms in their fields and are able to detect elephants on arrival Now the elephants have to ring the bell to come to our farms is a joke shared by farmers about the trip alarm Another effective method is the use of chillybased deterrents Green chilly paste with tobacco powder is used to make chilly rope and chilly curtain and hung around the harvested rice stack The strong pungent smell of this paste masks the smell of ripe paddy and also acts as an irritant for the elephants Burning chudi or grass bundle laced with chilly is another useful method Dry grass along with red chilly pods tobacco coconut shell is bundled to make a 9 feet long grass bundle which is kept near the boundary and allowed to burn slowly generating thick smoke We have heard elephants sneezing and coughing when they inhaled the smoke Nowadays they have stopped coming this way says Soma Siddi from Bilki village Mr Guruprasad the forester of Kirwatti Range says that elephants have changed their path ever since they used the chilly smoke around the main entry point in his area In Africa the sound of honey bees Apis mellifera is used to deter the elephants We experimented with the sound on elephants feeding on crops and the results were dramatic The elephants fled within minutes of hearing the buzzing of bees and the farmers could not stop laughing on seeing this sight Bee sound is easy to use to drive away the elephants but if all farmers start using it the elephants will soon learn that it is an empty threat We are therefore encouraging the farmers to make beehive fences with wood logs and clay pots Suitable logs are smeared with wax and kept near crop fields for natural colonization by bees A few farmers were successful in colonization of the logs and pots by bees They reported that on smelling the wax the elephants avoided that path However colonized logs are a major attraction for sloth bears and even neighbouring farmers so they need to be protected from unwarranted attention This beehive fence has the potential to deter elephants and earn extra income by production of honey This method has a longterm potential to reduce the crop loss by elephants The methods mentioned above are made from locally available material are easy to use and costs between Rs 50 to 300 Our research biologist interviewed 408 farmers in the project area Of these 76 farmers are practicing crop guarding and their crop loss is lower than those who are not guarding their own crops Elephant experts find such solutions too simplistic It is true that the methods are simple They are based on the fact that presence of people in the crop field is a major psychological deterrent for elephants Since farmers are protecting their own crops they are able to take timely actions to reduce crop loss Our field biologist spent several nights with the farmers during the crop raiding season to encouraging them to drive away elephants using these methods He sums up his advice to the farmers in simple words Instead of waiting for help to arrive it is better to do something on your own and keep the elephants out Another issue of concern is human deaths that take place due to accidental encounters with elephants while working in the forests or walking to school or crossing the village road Elephants dont like surprises In selfdefence they attack the intruder and sadly the person dies Subsequently elephants are declared as rogues and they are either captured by the Forest Department or persecuted by the people Either way the elephants die too To avoid such unfortunate incidents it is advisable not to work alone or venture out during the night in elephant country Many casualities have been attributed to drunken state of people when they chance upon elephants in deep forests With vigilance and awareness among local people it is possible to avoid such incidents and save human lives Elephants are not faring any better In high conflict area they are shot and electrocuted by the farmers They are captured from the forests and many die during capture operations due to bizarre reasons overdose of tranquilizers injuries during capture and lack of veterinary care Those who survive are sent to elephant camps where their life is often quite miserable In addition to this they are run over by speeding trains and are poached for tusks and meat People are suffering and so are the elephants and there is no single solution to resolve this conflict In my understanding parallel efforts are need at various levels to address this issue Maintaining the integrity of elephant habitat prevention of encroachment and bamboo removal control on degradation of forests monitoring the elephant population induction of selfguarding practices among farmers an awareness on code of conduct for people in elephant areas improvement of captive elephant facility and developing a compassionate attitude towards elephants are of equal and immediate importance Addressing these issues will go a long way in easing the conflict of interest between people and elephants A lot of work is being done on human elephant issues all over the world Many learning need to be shared and adopted Among them a major learning is about the art of living with the elephants WRCS Wildlife Research and Conservation Society 2017 Shipping and Refund Policy Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions bottom of page"

Enigma of the Forest Owlet By Prachi Mehta WRCS Feb 22 2018 4 min read Updated Dec 3 2018 A ghost from the past The Forest Owlet Heteroglaux blewitti is a curious bird both by name and nature It has captured the imagination of many within and outside the country and for the right reasons The forest owlet has an interesting past associated with it Let us travel back in time to the 19th century It was in 1872 when an Irish officer Mr Francis Robert Blewitt F R Blewitt saw this different looking owl in Phooljar area in eastern Madhya Pradesh now in Chhattisgarh Perplexed by its somewhat confusing appearance he sent the specimen to Mr AO Hume a wellknown taxonomist and a civil servant in India Hume immediately recognized this owl as a new species for science and named it after Blewitt to acknowledge his contribution to Indian ornithology Interestingly recent literature mentions that the bird was originally collected by Mr William Blewitt who was FR Blewitts younger brother William Blewitt was a custom officer in Punjab so he decided to use the pseudonym of his elder brother to avoid his bosss wrath for spending time away from his office in Punjab for collecting birds in Central India However for us it is a Blewitts owl after all The Genus of forest owlet is another issue of recent contention At the time of its discovery in 1872 Hume established the genus Heteroglaux for the forest owlet based on its distinct morphology Although the forest owlet possesses superficial similarity with the spotted owlet Athene brama it is distinctly different The unspotted crown presence of full throat collar thickly feathered legs its lateral tail flicking habit and undulating flight are some of the most visible characteristics that made the taxonomists dedicate a unique genus Heteroglaux for a single species Scientists are still undecided about the correct genus for the forest owlet The ongoing molecular research on the phylogeny of the bird will be able to settle the longstanding query whether the forest owlet can continue being Heteroglaux or should be included in Athene It is a serious case of identity crisis The story of its apparent extinction and rediscovery is equally dramatic Between 1872 and 1884 six forest owlets was collected from the country the first one in 1872 by Blewitt second one in 1877 by Mr Valentine Ball from Orissa and four more during 18801883 by Mr James Davidson from Central Maharashtra After 1884 there were many report of forest owlet from various places in the country but all of them were cases of mistaken identity with that of the spotted In 1961 Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen reported having collected a forest owlet way back in 1914 from Mandvi in Gujarat thus extending its range further west One again intensive search was conducted for the forest owlet all over the country but it was unsuccessful Finally in 1972 Dr SD Ripley considered the possibility that the forest owlet may have been extinct from India So the Blewitts Owl got famous as a possibly extinct species Given this background one can imagine the surprise and excitement that was generated at the news of its rediscovery in 1997 The forest owlet made its reappearance after 113 long years in Indian ornithology and that revamped peoples curiosity in the bird It was rediscovered by Dr Pamela Rasmussen a scientist from USA Dr Rasmussen who had examined the preserved skins of forest owlet realized that the bird looked very different than the illustrations in Indian bird books and decided to survey the historical locations to look for the bird She found two birds from Taloda Reserve Forests of Maharashtra Her museum research also found out that the record of forest owlet from Gujarat was a false one as Col Meinertzhagen had stolen one specimen from Davidsons collection and claimed it as his own So much fuss and fraud over an owl Present status After its rediscovery BNHS and other organizations carried out surveys to determine the distribution of forest owlet in the country BNHS reported two new sites of forest owlet in India Khaknar Range in Burhanpur District of Madhya Pradesh and Melghat Tiger Reserve in Amravati District of Maharashtra Our organization carried out the distribution survey in five central Indian states namely Orissa Chhattisgarh Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra and Gujarat We found the forest owlet in two new sites in Khandwa district and a few new locations within the Melghat Tiger Reserve Forest Owlet population in Burhanpur and Khandwa districts are found in the teak dominated Reserved Forests Since Reserved Forests are nonprotected forests their management objectives are different These forests are being managed for mainly for timber extraction under Selective Felling The forest owlets inhabit teak forests and use tree cavities for nesting It is therefore essential to understand how timber logging would impact the species In December 2012 WRCS in collaboration with Madhya Pradesh Forest Department initiated a longterm study on forest owlet in Khandwa district The main focus of the study is to examine distribution demography and ecology of forest owlet in logged forests of the area The results of the study will be useful in answering basic questions about habitat selection nesting breeding and dispersal pattern of the forest owlet The study is being supported by Department of Science and Technology MBZ species conservation fund and Raptor Research and Conservation Foundation RRCF Mumbai This study has been completed in December 2017 and has generated useful information on conservation of the species Getting Started Wildlife Research and Conservation Society 2017 Shipping and Refund Policy Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions bottom of page"

Elephants are ready are you Dr Prachi Mehta Achievement More news on elephant project Elephants Ring the bell Shop Blog Cart Human elephant coexistence in North Kanara The North Kanara District of Karnataka State has a population of about 60 Asian elephants This particular population of elephants is a descendant of an earlier generation that faced severe persecution by local communities during late 19th century The North Kanara District has the largest forest cover in the state Yet the landscape is fragmented with cultivation plantations and village settlements Although the intensity of humanelephant conflict in the district is relatively low it is expected to rise in the near future due to increase in irrigation leading to increased sugarcane cultivation summer paddy cultivation and encroachment If elephants and local people have to coexist it is important that adverse impact of each others presence and activities should be minimized Through this project we have introduced the concept of Communitybased Conflict Management CBCM as a model that empowers the local community in effective guarding methods and in reducing the crop loss due to elephants The project has introduced the concept of Communitybased Conflict Management CBCM to the Farmers and Forest officers Through CBCM we have emphasized on change in attitude and responsibility towards conflict mitigation This concept being new in India requires constant discussions with the stakeholders before they start adopting the practices The project demonstrated to the farmers that a sure way to reduce crop loss is by being alert selfsufficient and diversify their sources of income A beginning has been made reduce negative impact of elephant presence on people but will require intensive followup actions to realize this outcome Till 1999 the elephants in North Kanara landscape represented the northernmost population of Asian elephants in the Western Ghats In 2002 a few elephants moved northwards and began exploring the neighbouring state of Maharashtra This movement of elephants started humanelephant conflict in newer areas of Northern Karnataka and southern Maharashtra In 2009 WRCS initiated a pilot project on implementation of communitybased management of humanelephant conflict in North Kanara region After the initial success of the project WRCS received financial support from Asian Elephant Conservation Fund AECF from US Fish and Wildlife Service to continue the project The objectives of the project are to Develop and Implement Conflict Mitigation Measures in Affected Villages of North Kanara with involvement of Local Farmers to monitor elephant movement by participation of the Local Community and the Forest Department to generate awareness about LongTerm Elephant Conservation in the Area Through the project we have demonstrated the use of trip alarms chillybased barriers nightguarding and beehive fences Till date over 500 farmers have adopted various measures of protecting their own crops Farmers have started night guarding from the safety of treewatchtowers and installing trip alarms Chilly smoke is another useful lowcost measure that is being used widely in the area to keep away the elephants Each season the farmers and field staff light the chilly smoke in most vulnerable spots and have reported much less damage to crops Inspired by Dr Lucy Kings experiment on beehive fences in Africa we are developing low cost beehives in clay pots bamoo and loghives This is a promising measure to keep away the elephants and can give economic benefits to the farmer too In 2015 we arranged a series of interstate workshops to train the fied staff and local farmers across the country in the CBCM model The workshops were arranged at Kulgi Nature Camp and were attended by 120 participants from Chhattisgarh West Bengal Nagaland Nepal and Odisha State Many participants are now practicing these measures in their area for reducing crop loss See some of the
