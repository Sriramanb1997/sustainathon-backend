not having anybody to talk to about insects wrote Charles Darwin in 1828 when he was 17 His words highlight how insects have few admirers Its time we give them the attention they deserve By Rithwik Sundar The giant bug in absurdist Czech novelist Franz Kafkas novella The Metamorphosis is perhaps literatures most iconic insect yet Kafkas protagonist Gregor transforms into a giant bug symbolising disgust and his perceived lower status in society But that is fiction and prose In reality insects are superheroes They are the foundation of this vast web of life that sustains us all They pollinate our crops and keep soils healthy In history you may know of a lucrative trade route that emerged in the second century BC stretching from eastern China to the Mediterranean the Silk Route The trade routes origins link to the unfortunate practice of boiling or steaming an insect alive the silkworm From their delicate cocoons humankind produced silk a fabric so prized it ignited a trade that it would reshape realms and change the world forever In many ways insect life also mirrors striking parallels to human life From complex social behaviours to persistence these small wonders of the Animal

That When a bee colony grows large and new queens emerge the old queen and a portion of the workers set off in a temporary swarm searching for a new home Scout bees venture out to explore potential nesting sites each returning with a discovery But the decision isnt made by one bee alone its a democratic effort The scouts communicate their finds through a dance each movement revealing the

excreted after feasting on plant sap In a remarkable mutualistic relationship ants milk the aphids by gently stroking them coaxing out the sugary substance Some aphids even rely entirely on ants unable to excrete waste without their help In return for the honeydew ants protect their aphid herd from predators move them to fresh food sources and even safeguard aphid eggs during winter This partnership is a perfect transaction aphids supply food while ants offer protection and care ensuring both thrive in harmony Ants protect aphids and aphids feed ants a mutually beneficial relationship Photo Prathamesh GhadekarSanctuary Photolibrary Carpe Diem Mayflies have the shortest known adult lifespan in the insect world living only for a single day After emerging from their aquatic larval stage they rise to the surface in vast swarms In this brief moment their sole purpose is to mate and reproduce before their short lives come to an end Their time above water is a frantic celebration of life mating laying eggs and ensuring the survival of the next generation This oneday existence though fleeting is natures design to maximise reproduction with the collective emergence overwhelming predators and allowing enough mayflies to fulfil their mission Silkworms were the reason behind the formation of the Silk Route Photo GorkaazkCCBY30 Trust The Process Few creatures undergo such dramatic transformations as butterflies and dragonflies The butterfly begins as a tiny egg and hatches into a voracious caterpillar devouring everything in sight before entering a quiet suspended cocoon Then it emerges gracefully to take flight For humans the butterflys final form is aweinspiring but every stage even the wriggly caterpillar is vital Similarly dragonflies start their lives in water hatching as tiny larvae They shed their skin multiple times develop wing pads and when fully grown climb out of the water to undergo their final moult While dragonflies skip the pupal stage their ability to thrive in both water and air makes their transformation no less remarkable Both insects demonstrate the power of change trust and perseverance A freshly emerged dragonfly whose colour

Cara Tejpal G oaded by the endless stream of lockdown productivity on display on my Instagram feed I too threw myself into a challenge of my own making I decided to invest my time in watching the shorter works of Indias wildlife filmmakers The guidelines I concocted for my project were simple I would watch a documentary a day for 10 days If I were cruel enough to be ranking the films in order of my preference three of them would be vying for top spot Saravanakumars A Dream of Trees proved to be an exquisite exploration of the rewilding work of the Nature Conservation Foundations scientists TR Shankar Raman and Divya Mudappa in the Anamalai Hills of the Western Ghats The sweeping shots beautiful vistas story of resurrection and even the slightly wooden voiceovers by the protagonists fit together seamlessly a happy marriage of art and science Ajay and Vijay the second generation Bedi brothers have done justice to their legacy with The Secret Life of Frogs Shot over a period of three years in the Western Ghats this is a delightful juicy watch The sequences dedicated to the elusive endemic and endangered purple frog are particularly jawdropping and a breakthrough in our understanding of this species My one critique would be of the Canadianaccented English narration Its a mismatch for the script that is narrated from Vijays point of view Minor gripes aside its a spectacular film that I intend to watch again The wild card entry into my top three selection is rookie Gunjan Menons The Firefox Guardian Barely a quarter of an hour long the film is set in the eastern Himalayan wilderness of Nepal where Menuka a young Nepali woman protects community forests inhabited by red pandas Another filmmaker may have tried to capitalise on Menukas charm or the star quality of the fire fox but Menon allows for the film to unfold gently and organically Menon tells a succinct moving story and testament to her success is the fact that I was left weteyed by the film The Firefox Guardian is available to watch on Vimeo but youll have to ask Gunjan for the password Find her on Instagram Having glimpsed the challenges to nature documentary filmmaking in India Im disinclined to be overly critical of any such film Natural history and conservation storytelling are crucial to both documentation and public awareness and I have immense respect for those who follow this path So take this less as a review and more as my personal musings Each of the films I watched had much merit Munmun Dhalarias The Jujuranas Kingdom was a lovely sortie into the life and status of the stunning Western Tragopan Rita Banerjis Gaur in my Garden while not a patch on her awardwinning The Wildmeat Trail is a rustic analysis of humangaur interactions in Kotagiri Shekar Dattatris Chilika Jewel of Odisha and The Race to Save the Amur Falcon are brimming with information and neatly delivered The latter in particular will be of interest to birders and those looking for an inspirational success story Im a little more conflicted about the remaining three films on my list Do you remember being bundled into your schools AV room to watch an informative documentary I do I also remember recognising the value of these films while simultaneously getting fidgety and thats the feeling I got while watching Eastern Himalaya by Sandesh Kadur and Dr Kamaljit Bawa for ATREE Where the Sarus Sings by Divya Bhardwaj for WTI and Himachals Avian Paradise by Mike Pandey for the Himachal Pradesh Forest Department I suspect that some of these filmmakers skills may have been undermined by their commissioning organisations I must not be too off the mark because a crew member associated with one of them sent me a message saying Watching this Its a lesson on how bureaucrats can destroy films I contend that a steady diet of foreign natural history films has dulled our palate as viewers To diversify to taste nuance to actually delve into local conservation issues will require us to dive into the evergrowing pool of homegrown talent If you do like me youll discover meaningful wellcrafted stories at par with any other in the world Cara Tejpal leads conservation

Sanctuary Asia Vol 45 No 2 February 2025 By Praveen Gupta Those are not my words in the heading but will surely resonate with many Let me share some compelling reasons Pandemic Pipeline The strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 currently spreading among dairy cows in the US only needs a single mutation to readily latch on to human cells found in the upper airway This could have major implications for a new pandemic if such a mutation were to become widespread in nature In close proximity to the above findings comes a release from Lloyds of London the preeminent insurance and reinsurance market in the world that the global economy could be exposed to potential losses of USD 136 trillion over a fiveyear period from the threat of a hypothetical future human pandemic H5N1 a subtype of the influenza A virus has affected a wide range of animal populations including wild birds bears foxes a variety of marine mammals and most recently dairy cows Photo Public DomainNiaidCdc These losses could result from widespread disruption across global industries owing to local lockdowns and global travel restrictions With the transportation sector worth more than 10 per cent of global GDP sustained international travel restrictions could result in significant economic costs Whilst on the subject I am always reminded of how organisers of Wimbledon 2020 mitigated potential financial loss as the event was cancelled by means of an infectious diseases cover Likewise smart risk management saved the University of Illinois UrbanaChampaign despite the loss of revenue from mainland Chinese students one of their biggest sources of income not turning up in the year of COVID Affirmative Cover Ever since the insurance industry has developed a range of specialist solutions to help manage the risks associated with pandemics This includes affirmative cover for new outbreaks of known and unnamed infectious diseases insurance for development transit and storage of vaccines and protection against interruption or cancellation of events during a pandemic The insurance industry has discovered a segment ripe for monetisation What was once conveniently labelled as a black swan event is now a market development opportunity The H5N1 virus responsible for the current outbreak was first detected in North America in 2021 According to the Scientific American it has affected a wide range of animal populations including wild birds bears foxes a variety of marine mammals and most recently dairy cows Surprisingly nowhere does the report by Lloyds allude to a zoonotic trigger emanating from biodiversity loss Its CEO John Neal has identified that Lloyds has a unique position and opportunity to bring together communities businesses insurers and governments to find solutions to the systemic risks that threaten our shared future Whether that will be achievable notwithstanding the climate breakdown is conspicuous by its absence from the narrative and blind spots such as the ones described below Climate Models Falling Short Climate models are falling behind reality New research reveals that realworld data shows more extreme and unexpected climate changes than models predict writes Kasper Benjamin Reimer Bj\u00f8rkskov His findings come from Global emergence of regional heatwave hotspots outpaces climate model simulations a study by Kai Kornhuber Samuel Bartusek Richard Seager and Mingfang Ting in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences PNAS Most models he explains cannot simulate the smallscale processes that drive Earths climate systems such as jet streams cloud formation soil moisture interactions and ocean currents These daily processes combine in complex ways that models cant fully capture Thereby Extreme events such as heat storms and marine heatwaves are occurring faster and more intensely than existing models predict The interconnected systems of land atmosphere and oceans are reacting in nonlinear ways and amplifying in a manner we didnt expect Climate models underestimate extreme trends by up to 4x in some areas Twothirds of the Earths population depends on monsoon rain largely to grow its crops Research is scant on how a possible shift of rain bands to the south could impact India east Asia and west Africa Photo Asian Development Bank CC BYNCND 20 Our understanding of the climate crisis must therefore evolve models need to account for these overlooked processes Moreover the gap between models and reality is widening The science is clear the climate is changing faster than we are prepared for A key message coming out loud and clear from climate scientists PNAS study mentioned above is that the best way to reduce both uncertainty in and exposure to climate impacts is a rapid transition of relevant societal sectors away from fossil fuels to stabilise global temperature rise Imagine the implications of the highlighted deficiencies in the models used by reinsurers and insurers in their risk evaluations These are without doubt compelling reasons for money pipelines not just insurers to hasten moving away from fossil fuel Climate Endgame The paper Climate Endgame Exploring catastrophic climate change scenarios in PNAS makes a strong case for why planetary wellbeing should not be ignored Allow me to highlight some of the crucial messages Climate risks are becoming more complex and difficult to manage and are cascading across regions and sectors There is ample evidence that climate change could become catastrophic Understanding extreme risks is important for robust decisionmaking from preparation to consideration of emergency responses We could enter such endgames at even modest levels of warming This requires exploring not just higher temperature scenarios but also the potential for climate change impacts to contribute to systemic risk and other cascades A thorough risk assessment would need to consider how risks spread interact amplify and are aggravated by responses from people Even simpler compound hazard analyses of interacting climate hazards and drivers are underused Yet this is how risk unfolds in the real world For example when a cyclone destroys electrical infrastructure it leaves a population vulnerable to an ensuing deadly heat wave Too much is at stake to refrain from examining highimpact lowlikelihood scenarios The COVID19 pandemic has underlined the need to consider and prepare for infrequent highimpact global risks and the systemic dangers they can spark It is time to seriously scrutinise the best way to expand our research horizons to cover this field suggest the authors The proposed Climate Endgame research agenda provides one way to navigate this understudied area Facing a future of accelerating climate change while blind to worstcase scenarios is naive risk management at best and fatally foolish at worst The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC has yet to give focused attention to catastrophic climate change This does appear warranted following the IPCCs decision framework Such a report could investigate how Earth system feedback could alter temperature trajectories and whether these are irreversible There is growing evidence that climate change could be catastrophic yet fossil fuel emissions reached record highs in 2024 The past year alone has seen a series of severe climate disasters around the world Extreme events such as heat storms and marine heatwaves are occurring faster and more intensely than models predict Photo Asian Development BankCC BYNCND 20 A Slowing Earth System The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation AMOC is part of a single conveyor belt of continuous water exchange that transports water throughout the worlds oceans It is the main ocean current in the Atlantic ocean including at the surface and at great depths that are driven by changes in weather temperature and salinity Humanity is driving up unhindered fossil fuel burning and relentless deforestation particularly in the Amazon and also the related skyrocketing greenhouse gas GHG emissions and melting Arctic and Greenland which are transforming water chemistry and dynamics This is leading to a slow down and eventually a tipping point as per renowned scientists such as Stefan Rahmstorf A weaker AMOC would decrease the movement of hot and cold ocean water bringing less warm water northwards leaving warmth in the tropics and cold in the polar areas This could make hot areas hotter and cold areas colder This slowing down of the AMOC could affect precipitation patterns strengthen storms and raise the sea level along the North American Atlantic coast Research is scant on how a possible movement of rain bands moving south could impact India east Asia and west Africa These geographies could very well lose much or all of their monsoon seasons Twothirds of the Earths population depends on monsoon rain largely to grow its crops These changes could happen within only a few growing seasons rather than over generations leaving little time to adapt Just like several plant and animal species that would not be able to adapt fast enough to changing weather patterns and thus face the risk of extinction Cascading global climate failure This is a causal loop diagram in which a complete line represents a positive polarity eg amplifying

Vol 45 No 2 February 2025 By Somreet Bhattacharya and Mudit Gupta R aghu one of the robust males at the Rhino Rehabilitation Area within the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve grunted before running off into the grasslands silhouetted against the setting sun near the Sunaripur range in the tiger reserve More than 40 years after the reintroduction of the onehorned rhino to the Terai landscape Raghu became the first of his kind to be freeranged into the wild on November 27 2024 Two other rhinos both females were freeranged subsequently The beating heart of the Terai wilderness awoke to the heavy steps of the remarkable beast The unicorn of Indias grasslands marked its full return to the land that was once its home Many today might know the onehorned rhino as a mammal exclusive to states such as Assam where it is a crowdpuller in Kaziranga living alongside people in the Pobitora landscape and roaming free in the alluvial grasslands of Manas or to the state of West Bengal where it thrives in the Dooars region particularly in Jaldapara and Gorumara National Parks or associate it to Nepals Chitwan There is evidence however that the onehorned rhino once occupied a wide range in the Indian subcontinent extending from the Indus river valley in the west to the Brahmaputra valley in the east The greater onehorned rhino on the famous Pashupati seal from Mohenjodaro hints of the presence of this species in northern India According to the Central Zoo Authority the rhino ranged from Brahmaputra valley in the East to Indus valley in the West There are also references to it as a sport animal in Baburnama the memoirs of the founder of the Mughal Empire Babur We learned that the species had occupied the entire stretch of the subcontinent until the more recent 19 th century Considered a favourite among game hunters and colonial military officers the greater onehorned rhinoceros became locally extinct in parts of northern India There is evidence that the onehorned rhino once occupied a wide range in the Indian subcontinent extending from the Indus river valley in the west to the Brahmaputra valley in the east However as a favourite among game hunters and colonial military officers the greater onehorned rhinoceros became locally extinct in parts of northern India Photo Jai MohanSanctuary Photolibrary The release of three greater onehorned rhinos Rhinoceros unicornis at the Dudhwa National Park has rekindled hope for this species to thrive once again in its historical habitat Looking Back In the 1950s it became clear to wildlife enthusiasts and conservationists that rhinos were disappearing as they observed the last remaining individuals in northern India specifically in the Pilibhit forests in Uttar Pradesh This decline also impacted the swamp deer population as their ecosystem was closely tied to the rhinos Concern was raised among policy leaders and in August 1979 the Asian Rhino Specialist Group of the IUCN Survival Service Commission now known as the Species Survival Commission emphasised that steps must be taken to establish additional viable population units in suitable areas preferably in the rhinos former distribution range Following up on these recommendations of the Asian Rhino Specialist Group the Wildlife Status Evaluation Committee of the Indian Board For Wildlife appointed a subcommittee to consider alternative rhino translocation areas in the same year The Dudhwa National Park was selected to be the most promising because of habitat similarities with Assams Kaziranga National Park where rhinos thrived for several centuries the fact that rhinos had been recorded in this area till the last century and the adequacy of the protection available for their survival In 1984 a crash of five rhinos was flown in a chartered heavy lift aircraft from Guwahati to Delhi I remember reading a news article that said that rhinos indeed can fly The Dudhwa Tiger Reserve is dotted with a vast expanse of dense sal forest interspersed with large stretches of grasslands bordered by lakes and wetlands These areas are home to threatened species such as the swamp deer Bengal Florican and Swamp Francolin It is perhaps one of the few habitats that sustains the threatened Terai landscape Photo Sangeeta DhanukaSanctuary Photolibrary In Sanctuarys JulySeptember Vol IV No 3 1984 issue Samar Singh formerly Joint Secretary Forests and Wildlife and Director Wildlife Preservation Government of India New Delhi wrote about the flight of the rhinos Five dustladen trucks carrying an equal number of rhinos rumbled into Dudhwa in the early hours of April 1 1984 after an 18hour journey from Delhi The five rhinos had earlier performed an historic flight in a specially chartered Aeroflot cargo aircraft hired by the Government of India to fly them from Guwahati to Delhi Accompanying them in flight was a small party headed by the Director Wildlife Government of India who confirmed that the rhinos posed virtually no problems en route and that the twoandahalf hour journey sitting within touching distance of the armoured animals was exciting and memorable On arrival at New Delhis Palam airport the rhinos were given a VIP reception by a crowd of enthusiasts But why the fuss Why Dudhwa What next These very legitimate questions are still uppermost in the minds of many people and certainly need to be answered There are four main reasons why this episode must be recognised as historic First it is easily one of the largest operation of its kind ever undertaken in the subcontinent If it succeeds it will change the concept of wildlife management in the region said one wildlife expert Secondly it follows soon after the adoption of the National Wildlife Action Plan which gives priority to the reintroduction of endangered and threatened species and therefore lends tremendous credibility to the intentions and capabilities of the Government of India Thirdly there is worldwide concern about the status of the rhino leading to an international campaign during 1982 which was called the Year of the Rhino And finally the arrival of the rhinos at Dudhwa was a home coming of sorts in as much as they were returning to an area which was once the natural home of the rhino until about a hundred years ago A part of the Dudhwa National Park was converted into the Rhino Reintroduction Area RRA in the South Sunaripur Range comprising the Kakraha Block and a part of the Chhota Palia Block The RRA has nine permanent large and small lakes The chain of these lakes lies along the damar sal and grassland ecotone These lakes and two nullahs Andhra and Chabakwa are old courses of the river Suheli forming the ideal rhino habitat While the initial project aimed to release the rhinos into the wild once they acclimate with the Dudhwa ecosystem several factors including concerns about poaching led to a delay that consumed over four decades In the meantime the number of rhinos in RRA increased to more than two dozen Inbreeding was found after a DNA study was conducted under the RhoDIS India programme Rhino DNA Index system that adopts a molecular approach for rhino forensics and population management This helps in understanding the genetic status of the existing population for longterm conservation and assessing the probabilities of inbreeding among each individual Based on this the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department relocated a batch of rhinos to a new Rhino Rehabilitation Area in 2018 However the decision to freerange the animals took longer since the entire ecosystem had to be prepared around the new rhino presence Lalit K Verma Chief Conservator and Field Director of the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve is optimistic that freeranging rhinos will help revive the habitat and establish a source population in northern India We are hoping that the rhinos range will expand across the Terai gradually it is their historical range he adds One of the crates being prepared for the rhino freeranging programme at the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve Photo Courtesy Somreet Bhattacharya Monitoring The Unicorns For Mohammad Irshad a staff member at the Salukhapur elephant camp within the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve monitoring the rhinos with his team of mahouts forms a significant part of their daytoday activities The animals here are adapted to the environment within the RRAs Our monitoring involves ascertaining the behaviour of each individual we spot he says as he climbs onto the back of his elephant Gajraj The tracking teams have identified each of the 40odd rhinos within the rehabilitation area with physical features such as a cut on the lip or a shorter ear and named them for identification Raghu being one of them Irshad and his team carry binoculars and have spent almost all day identifying and observing the rhinos within the rehabilitation area Now that the animals are accustomed to our presence it becomes easier for us to spot them even if the elephants go near Irshad adds The Status Of Rhinos In India About 813 per cent of the global population of the great onehorned rhino is in India The current number stands at 4014 individuals that reside within Indias national parks and wildlife sanctuaries Status of rhino population 50 years ago vs now The rhino population has surged by approximately 170 per cent since the 1980s growing from 1500 to over 4000 today Conservation threats including range decline and opportunities Poaching is an omnipresent threat to rhinos based on the myth of the medicinal properties of its horn in Chinese Traditional Medicine Throughout their presentday range their habitat continues to dwindle fast as their preferred grassland habitats are threatened by invasive species weeds and natural succession to woodlands The habitats are also threatened by visible changes in water availability and flow patterns How are we ensuring habitat protection for the species in Dudhwa and the landscape 1 Active grassland management through removal of invasive species such as lantana and the introduction of palatable species 2 Managing wetlands by maintaining adequate water levels and the growth of wild grasses 3 Ensuring active protection of species through GPS and VHF monitoring Rhinos Adapting To The Wild The freeranging programme aimed to reestablish a viable population by increasing its habitat range reducing the risk of inbreeding and increasing the genetic diversity within the Dudhwa rhino population The rhinos would be able to interact with others of their kind from Nepal that frequent the tiger reserve a significant step towards species recovery in the region The Dudhwa Tiger Reserve is dotted with a vast expanse of dense sal forest interspersed with large stretches of grasslands that are bordered by lakes and wetlands that are home to threatened species such as the swamp deer Rucervus duvaucelii duvaucelii Bengal Florican Houbaropsis bengalensis and Swamp Francolin Ortygornis gularis and is perhaps one of the few habitats that sustains the threatened Terai ecosystem A growing rhino population is good news for the species and benefits the larger Terai region shared between India and Nepal The state Forest Department and various NGOs play an important role in making this possible Photo Nishant AndrewsSanctuary Photolibrary Amit Sharma lead for the rhino conservation programme at WWFIndia adds that the freeranging of the greaterone horned rhinos gives a fresh lease to these waterbodies Rhinos are megaspecies that not only use the wetland but also the wet soil which engineers the development of new puddles that eventually add to the stagnant water and sustain all other lifeforms that depend on it he says WWFIndia has been supporting the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department in setting up baseline information on the state of these tall grasslandwetland mosaics Locally called phanta and taal respectively these ecoregions are essential for other faunal species such as fishing cats The biggest challenge for the Forest Department and WWFIndia team was selecting a suitable habitat for freeranging the animals A growing rhino population is good news for the species and benefits the larger Terai region shared between India and Nepal Known for its robust agricultural productivity the Terai is the food basket of the area that sustains the largest population of other keystone species such as the Bengal tiger and the Asian elephant However the Terai region in Uttar Pradesh also faces extreme ecological pressure because of habitat loss and human activities The presence of rhinos helps vegetation such as grasses shrubs and wetlands thrive eventually adding to the sustenance of other smaller species such as birds and mammals With inputs from Amit Sharma lead for the rhino conservation programme at WWFIndia Dr Mudit Gupta landscape lead

Protective Area Network The project is based on an innate belief that communities living closest to our most biodiverse wonderlands deserve to be the primary beneficiaries and custodians of our vanishing biodiversity The effect of this initiative is to expand the size and improve the quality of habitat available to wildlife by encouraging local communities to convert their own marginal and failed farms back to its natural wild state The landholding will continue to be in the hands of the community but would serve as biodiverse nature refuges capable of offering communities assured

February 2025 By Muralidharan Manoharakrishnan From this distant vantage point the Earth might not seem of particular interest But for us its different Consider again that dot Thats here thats home thats us On it everyone you love everyone you know everyone you ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives Carl Sagan I remember reading Carl Sagans famous lines about the pale blue dot a phrase he coined after seeing an image of Earth captured by the Voyager spacecraft in the early 1990s It struck me how in that vast expanse of space our planets most distinctive feature was the waters that cover it Its ironic really A planet so dominated by oceans is called Earth yet these waters remain some of the least explored parts of our world The oceans and coasts are home to a stunning variety of life From the tiniest plankton which produce 50 to 80 per cent of the worlds oxygen to entire ecosystems ranging from estuaries mangroves and rocky shores to seagrasses coral reefs and the open seas theres so much life teeming beneath the surface Ive often thought about how throughout history humans have relied on the oceans to connect with each other build civilisations and develop coastal towns and cities A typical view out in the open seas with nothing but a vast blue expanse until the horizon truly provides perspective on the sheer size of the oceans Photo Nikhil John Indias shores much like those of the rest of the world have been inhabited for millennia With over 45 million people living along its 7500 km coastline the country is home to bustling cities towns and villages each with its own unique relationship with the sea The fisheries and marine wildlife found here are incredibly diverse Major ports such as Mumbai Chennai and Kolkata have historically served as vital economic centres connecting India to the rest of the world Its remarkable how much of our history and future is tied to the waters that surround us This overlap of regions being used by humans and wild species makes the oceans and coasts an interesting yet challenging space to conserve wildlife and its habitat Most terrestrial wild spaces are located in sparsely populated regions of the country where resource extraction is minimal and boundaries are more clearly visible In contrast coastal and marine areas represent the opposite For example the very act of fishing which is an acceptable practice across human societies could be seen as a form of hunting when seen under the lens of traditional wildlife conservation This frequently comes out in an interesting form of conflict particularly through bycatch where some protected species are accidentally caught in different fishing gear during regular fishing operations while others are increasingly being targeted When Does A Fish Become Wildlife Prior to the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 all marine species including sea turtles came under the premise of fisheries and were considered fair catch There are records of egg harvests through a licenced practice called anda kara during the Kanika dynasty followed by the registered transport of live sea turtles as cargo on trains from Puri to the markets of Kolkata for consumption Following this many more marine species received conservation attention by being brought under the Act starting with the whale shark as the first protected fish This was followed by other shark species marine mammals all whales and dolphins corals sea cucumbers seahorses and many shells The latest edition of the Act includes more species of sharks rays and charismatic and endangered marine fish such as the bump head parrotfish The main challenge with the management of protecting these species is that they occur in close proximity to other legally and commercially harvested fish species Apart from this many of these species arent limited to small regions and are highly migratory with their breeding coinciding with the peaks of the fishing season Accessing marine habitats presents a unique set of challenges It demands not only reliable seaworthy vessels capable of withstanding the rigours of ocean travel but also requires individuals to possess specialised training and navigational skills Unfortunately wildlife managers have noted a lack of training in these competencies which hampers effective exploration and conservation efforts in marine environments A common point of concern raised by coastal communities is the lack of discussion with the fishers before declaring the capture of these species as illegal andor the availability of implementable alternatives or technologies to avoid their capture The development of techniques to avoid the accidental capture of protected species have ranged from the modification of nets such as Turtle Excluder Devices TEDs in trawl nets placing visual deterrents such as silhouettes and flashing LEDs in gillnets and acoustic pingers that emit high frequency sounds to allow marine mammals to avoid regions where fishing occurs However none of these are widely implemented by fishers so far Coastal community youth have in recent years found meaningful employment engaging in sea turtle conservation with NGOs as well as Forest Departments Photo Muralidharan M Seasonal Cycles Of Fishing And Turtle Breeding This overlap in shared spaces is also temporal occurring from November to April across the Indian coast which is both the peak fishing season and the height of the holiday season along the coast in states such as Goa This is most prominently observed in the case of the olive ridley sea turtle the most ubiquitous species of sea turtle along the Indian coast which comes to breed and nest on our shores during the same period before migrating into deeper offshore waters of the Bay of Bengal During this time newspapers and news often highlight the mortalities that occur with alarming headlines However its important to note that nesting numbers of the same species have increased at sites across much of the Indian coast and globally This is owing to the decline in targeted hunting and improved conservation measures including hatcheries managed by NGOs and state governments The narrative frequently casts fishers in a negative light when turtles accidentally get caught in their nets It suggests seemingly simple solutions such as stricter enforcement of laws and increased patrols at sea akin to the efforts made in terrestrial Protected Areas However these suggestions overlook the immense and complex nature of the oceans which are far beyond what can be easily monitored or controlled The ongoing conflict surrounding the olive ridley turtles in the state of Odisha is far from a new issue Odisha is renowned for one of the worlds largest nesting grounds for these remarkable sea turtles Every year lakhs of olive ridley turtles gather along its sandy shores to lay their eggs Unfortunately alongside this incredible natural spectacle the turtles also face significant threats including unintentional mortalities caused by human activities The discussions between conservationists and fishers have been ongoing for more than two decades at this point and have yet to reach a commonly accepted consensus The concerns brought up by fishers usually begin by pushing the blame onto a different type of fishing gear or fishers from the neighbouring states entering illegally From trawl nets to large gill nets to pursering seines to bottom set trammel nets with each net being designed for catching different fish species in different regions and different seasons there is often a rapid decision to ban a practice without detailed consultations Likewise the ongoing issue of TEDs stemming from US sanctions on the import ban of wildcaught shrimp has created significant concerns about losing a highvalue market on account of the failure to use TEDs The concern with TEDs has primarily to do with the loss of catch that occurs on its installation While scientists claim this loss to be around three to 10 per cent fishers claim it is closer to 20 to 30 per cent An olive ridley dives into the waters to forage for shrimp and fish for which humans also share a proclivity Photo Rajarshi BanerjiSanctuary Photolibrary Declining Fish And Livelihoods It is not commonly known that our oncethriving nearshore fisheries have hit major declines in the last two decades on account of the increase in mechanised fisheries taking over the spaces of artisanal fishers Despite statelegislated Marine Fisheries Regulation Acts in place across all states which also demarcates where different types of vessels and gears can be operated implementing these regulations presents challenges The decline in fish stocks now means that even a three per cent loss in catch from reducing the bycatch of turtles or marine mammals can affect the overall profits of a fishing vessel and the livelihoods that depend on it This loss of livelihood has already been observed to have pushed community youth away from their traditional practices driving them toward other forms of labour and causing their migration away from their native villages As a result there is a growing sense of detachment among them and a lack of ownership of local spaces With all these challenges combined over a shared space the solutions for this require a different form of dialogue and action Fishers conservationists scientists managers and legislators have to work together on an equal playing field without pitting one against the other It is quite clear that the intentional capture of most of these species is not desired by fishers and their primary concern lies in getting a fair compensation or markets that can make up for their losses If a solution can be found that gives fishers a sense of ownership and responsibility for the protection of species that could be a winning solution This would require an overhaul of how marine conservation has been approached in India A multidisciplinary approach that can operate through conserving spaces and species while enhancing local livelihoods can be thought of With the call for protecting a large portion of seas to match our global conservation targets this is the right time for us to come up with new and innovative solutions Muralidharan M is the Lead for Marine Species at WWFIndia working towards the sustainable

Areas in Mukutban Range and its surrounds in Pandharkawda Division Yavatmal Forest Circle A Special Emphasis on the RCCPL Cement Project Mining Site Reserved Forest Area of 46745 ha in Forest Compartment No C26 C27 and C33 A in village Hirapur Govindpur and Piparwadi in Pandharkawda Forest Division of Yavatmal Forest Circle in Maharashtra was slated for diversion for limestone mining activity The Stage II Clearance had already been allocated to the aforesaid project by the MOEF CC Government of India The Stage II Clearance had been granted to the project on 12092017 and the Government of Maharashtra issued the diversion order on 22012018 However in the meanwhile it was noticed by the respective forest authorities in their respective jurisdiction that the aforesaid project site of the RCCPL is strategically located within an intervening landscape complex of 3 Protect Areas namely the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Maharashtra and the Kawal Tiger Reserve in the Telegana State and that it may adversely affect the intervening corridors in the region thereby adversely affecting the dispersal of tigers We were commissioned by RCCPL to make the Strategic Plan Executive Summary 3 Wildlife Management and Mitigation Plan for the Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station CSTPS Chandrapur Around five Tigers known to be inside have made the thermal power station area their permanent home over the past four or five years The Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station CSTPS is connected to TadobaAndhari Tiger Reserve TATR through a corridor of coal mines that is thickly covered with Prosopis species Adequate prey base in the form of stray cattle and wild boars substantial tree cover and a perennial nullah passing through the CSTPS help meet all the basic needs of these resident Tigers Tigers would come to the thermal power station from the TATR earlier as well However it would always be a fleeting visit which would often go unnoticed by people Now Tigers have made the CSTPS their habitat staying alongside people with ease Tiger sighting in the CSTPS did not bother the staff a couple of years ago but the fact that Tigers are making the thermal power station their habitat had them worried In order to find the solution to this issue it was decided by the CSTPS that a Wildlife Management and Mitigation Plan needs to be made We were therefore commissioned by the CSTPS to make the plan Wildlife and We Protection Foundation Wildlife and We Protection Foundation NATIONAL COORDINATION OFFICE Operations Services

Conservation scientists Nandini Velho and Umesh Srinivasan pen an open letter to Indias Forest Advisory Committee FAC The FAC is slated to deliberate on 12 agenda items including the diversion of 116556 ha of prime forest in Arunachal Pradesh for the Etalin HydroElectric Project in a virtual meeting on the morning of April 23 2020 Velho and Srinivasan put on record the largescale irreversible impacts of this project if forest clearance for it is approved Their concerns have been mirrored by hundreds of nature lovers who have also called for the FAC meeting to be postponed until such a time that the meeting can take place in person To The DirectorGeneral of Forests Chairperson Forest Advisory Committee Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change Government of India April 23 2020 Subject Concerns about forest diversion from the Etalin HydroElectric Project 3097 MW Dear Sir We write to you as wildlife scientists conservationists and concerned citizens about the potential diversion of highly biodiverse forest land in Arunachal Pradesh for the Etalin HydroElectric Project As you are no doubt aware Arunachal Pradesh has the highest biodiversity of any Indian state and is a global hotspot for biodiversity Even within Arunachal Pradesh Dibang Valley is a particular example of high species richness and ecological value With your kind consideration we would like to put on record our concerns to the Forest Advisory Committee for deliberation on File No 8202014FC on the Etalin Hydro Electric Project 3097 MW in Dibang Valley District of Arunachal Pradesh 1 PRESENCE OF TIGERS IN THE COMMUNITY FORESTS OF DIBANG VALLEY Studies in the Dibang Valley including areas which will see impacts of the proposed hydroproject show that community forests in the region are important habitats for Schedule I endangered species including tigers These studies have in fact been cited by a previous meeting of the Forest Advisory Committee F No 8202014FC dated 28 th February 2017 The fact sheet states that A long term monitoring study on mammalian fauna in Dibang WLS has recorded presence of few tigers outside sanctuary 523iii in F No 8202014FC This statement appears to be at odds with the results of a previous camera trapbased study that has found tigers to be widespread in Dibang Valley both in Dibang WLS and in community forest Under this study 283 camera traps were placed throughout Dibang Valley half in Dibang WLS and half in community forest Data obtained by these camera traps yielded photographs of 12 individual tigers eight of which were found in communitymanaged lands outside Dibang WLS The same study found tiger density in community forest to be 45 times as high as the density of tigers within parts of Dibang WLS This research was in fact cited by the minutes of the FAC meeting dated 28 th February 2017 based on which the FAC recommended conducting multiple seasonal replicate studies on biodiversity assessment as the current study EIA is completely inadequate in this regard 31vii in F No 8202014FC 2 SAMPLING AND INFERENTIAL DISCREPANCIES Second to scientifically infer that tiger presence differed significantly within and outside Dibang WLS would require comparable sampling effort in protected area and community forest both in terms of area covered and number of camera traps deployed This however does not appear to be the case Maps 65 66 and 67 in WIIs report seem to show that sampling effort outside Dibang WLS was far less than the effort within it Despite this tigers were photographed in a large majority of the few camera traps placed outside the sanctuary in community forest Indeed and hearteningly in November 2018 WII scientists published an article in the Journal of Threatened Taxa in which they recorded Indias highest tigers outside Dibang WLS in the community forests 3 TIGER DISPERSAL IN THE DIBANG LANDSCAPE The report goes on to say The linear distance measured for three nearest records location of tiger outside DWLS and between boundary of proposed project site ranged from 102 km to 1400 km from north till end of submergence Even discounting the fact that community forests in Dibang Valley harbour a much higher density of tigers than within DWLS these distances are very small for a tiger individual tigers have been known to travel distances in excess of 400 km Furthermore the dispersal of young tigers in search of new territories is at least severalfold higher than on the order of tens of kilometres Glimpses of the Dibang valley landscape 4 OTHER IMPORTANT SPECIES Beside the tiger neither the report published by the WII nor the one issued by the subcommittee that visited the project site between 10 th and 14 th February 2020 mentions published peerreviewed studies showing that Dibang Valley both the wildlife sanctuary and community forests support outstandingly rich biological diversity The most notable are the six different colour variations of the Asian golden cat Schedule I which are found throughout the district Dibang Valley hosts the highest colour variation of any wild cat species in the world making it a globally significant area both for conservation and to study ecological adaptability and evolution The FAC also noted in its minutes that 8 individual clouded leopards were recorded at various locations in Dibang Valley The clouded leopard is a Schedule I species classified as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature 5 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS Finally a critical issue is the cumulative impact of multiple hydropower projects on habitat of tiger and other wildlife in particular the cumulative impacts of the two biggest projects 3097 MW Etalin and 2880 MW Dibang Multipurpose project The Dibang basin study approved by MoEFCC has no analysis of cumulative impacts on tiger habitat The 2880 MW Dibang Multipurpose project was given final forest clearance last month in March 2020 Along with the Etalin project this will result in the destruction of a major chunk of the Dibang Valley 6 OTHER CONCERNS The FAC following its meeting on 28 th February 2017 rejected the first EIA as completely inadequate 31vii in F No 8202014FC and recommended a multiple seasonal replicate study on biodiversity assessment spanning 2 years to more comprehensively assess the environmental impact of the proposed project This multiseason EIA however appears not to have been conducted but instead converted into an impact mitigation plan as reported by the Indian Express 19 th December 2018 Further there is no record in the factsheet F No 8202014FC of how the requirement of a fresh Environment Impact Assessment to decide the ecological viability of the project as mandated by the FAC was waived by conversion into a Wildlife Conservation Plan With your kind consideration we would like to place these points on record for the committee to deliberate upon such that largescale irreversible impacts on the regions biodiversityrich primary

feed over 600 rivers with pure water and stabilise our wobbly climate in the process Kids for Tigers is an educational outreach programme that touches the lives of rural kids living right next to the tiger and urban kids across the country The tiger a metaphor for all of nature is a rallying point for children working to safeguard their own future Going way beyond conservation education the programme is dedicated to leaving kids with a better planet and leaving the planet with better kids Inspired through workshops nature walks camps and tiger fests a whole new generation of dedicated conservationists has emerged through the programme Long before it became the rage Kids for Tigers children found themselves invited to meet Governors Prime Ministers and Environment Ministers sports stars and celebrities editors and journalists where the young convinced the old that protecting nature is the best way to protect current and future generations Since its launch Kids for Tigers has snowballed into one of Indias largest mass movements to save the tiger impacting one million children In keeping with Sanctuarys core belief that nature is selfrepairing Kids for Tigers communicates the positive hope that all carnivores and their coinhabitants will spring back to safe numbers provided we leave nature alone long enough to allow its selfrepairing mechanisms to take effect Working with educationists we inform kids of the umbilicus between biodiversity forests water and climate change Photo Ripan Biswas About the programme Kids for Tigers introduces children to nature in a gentle reassuring and encouraging manner Our battery of events help kids imbibe the truth that nature is a source of life and not merely a resource Children targeted through the programme come under three categories grades 1 and 2 are given introductory lessons on our flora and fauna grades 3 to 5 are taught about interconnections and adaptations with nature through food chains and ecosystems and grades 6 to 8 are introduced to the concept of conservation its necessities challenges and solutions Once schools are enrolled on the yearlong programme email amandeepsanctuaryasiacom to learn more teachers are engaged in the Environmental Leadership Workshop to incorporate them into the Kids for Tigers curriculum Interactive sessions Tiger fests Save the Tiger campaign Nature exploration City camps National camps Kids for Tigers places a very high value on ethics curiosity and teambuilding The programme encourages children to engage with the elders in their life by sharing with them a sense of wonder and reminding them that soon it is the young that will take charge of planet Earth We take strength from the late Frederick Douglass who wisely advised It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men Photo Amrut Naik Milestones Kids for Tigers has been recognised for its significant impact on public opinion and support for nature and wildlife conservation in

Warn Worse Crises to Come Options Offered to Reduce Risk 540000 850000 unknown viruses in nature could still infect people Current economic impacts are 100 times the estimated cost of prevention F uture pandemics will emerge more often spread more rapidly do more damage to the world economy and kill more people than COVID19 unless there is a transformative change in the global approach to dealing with infectious diseases warns a major new report on biodiversity and pandemics by 22 leading experts from around the world Convened by the Intergovernmental SciencePolicy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services IPBES for an urgent virtual workshop about the links between degradation of nature and increasing pandemic risks the experts agree that escaping the era of pandemics is possible but that this will require a seismic shift in approach from reaction to prevention Courtesy IPBES COVID19 is at least the sixth global health pandemic since the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and although it has its origins in microbes carried by animals like all pandemics its emergence has been entirely driven by human activities says the report released on Thursday October 29 2020 It is estimated that another 17 million currently undiscovered viruses exist in mammals and birds of which up to 850000 could have the ability to infect people There is no great mystery about the cause of the COVID19 pandemic or of any modern pandemic said Dr Peter Daszak President of EcoHealth Alliance and chair of the IPBES workshop The same human activities that drive climate change and biodiversity loss also drive pandemic risk through their impacts on our environment Changes in the way we use land the expansion and intensification of agriculture and unsustainable trade production and consumption disrupt nature and increase contact between wildlife livestock pathogens and people This is the path to pandemics Pandemic risk can be significantly lowered by reducing the human activities that drive the loss of biodiversity by greater conservation of protected areas and through measures that reduce unsustainable exploitation of high biodiversity regions This will reduce wildlifelivestockhuman contact and help prevent the spillover of new diseases says the report Courtesy IPBES The overwhelming scientific evidence points to a very positive conclusion said Dr Daszak We have the increasing ability to prevent pandemics but the way we are tackling them right now largely ignores that ability Our approach has effectively stagnated we still rely on attempts to contain and control diseases after they emerge through vaccines and therapeutics We can escape the era of pandemics but this requires a much greater focus on prevention in addition to reaction The fact that human activity has been able to so fundamentally change our natural environment need not always be a negative outcome It also provides convincing proof of our power to drive the change needed to reduce the risk of future pandemics while simultaneously benefiting conservation and reducing climate change The report says that relying on responses to diseases after their emergence such as public health measures and technological solutions in particular the rapid design and distribution of new vaccines and therapeutics is a slow and uncertain path underscoring both the widespread human suffering and the tens of billions of dollars in annual economic damage to the global economy of reacting to pandemics Courtesy IPBES The IPBES workshop report is one of the most scientifically robust examinations of the evidence and knowledge about links between pandemic risk and nature since the COVID19 pandemic began with contributions from leading experts in fields as diverse as epidemiology zoology public health disease ecology comparative pathology veterinary medicine pharmacology wildlife health mathematical modelling economics law and public policy The report is strongly scientifically substantiated with almost than 700 cited sources more than 200 of which are from 2020 and 2019 which offers decisionmakers a valuable analytical snapshot of the most uptodate data currently available The report also offers a number of policy options that would help to reduce and address pandemic risk Among these are Launching a highlevel intergovernmental council on pandemic prevention to provide decisionmakers with the best science and evidence on emerging diseases predict highrisk areas evaluate the economic impact of potential pandemics and to highlight research gaps Such a council could also coordinate the design of a global monitoring framework Countries setting mutuallyagreed goals or targets within the framework of an international accord or agreement with clear benefits for people animals and the environment Institutionalising the One Health approach in national governments to build pandemic preparedness enhance pandemic prevention programs and to investigate and control outbreaks across sectors Developing and incorporating pandemic and emerging disease risk health impact assessments in major development and landuse projects while reforming financial aid for landuse so that benefits and risks to biodiversity and health are recognised and explicitly targeted Ensuring that the economic cost of pandemics is factored into consumption production and government policies and budgets Enabling changes to reduce the types of consumption globalised agricultural expansion and trade that have led to pandemics this could include taxes or levies on meat consumption livestock production and other forms of high pandemicrisk activities Reducing zoonotic disease risks in the international wildlife trade through a new intergovernmental health and trade partnership reducing or removing high diseaserisk species in the wildlife trade enhancing law enforcement in all aspects of the illegal wildlife trade and improving community education in disease hotspots about the health risks of wildlife trade Valuing Indigenous Peoples and local communities engagement and knowledge in pandemic prevention programs achieving greater food security and reducing consumption of wildlife Closing critical knowledge gaps such as those about key risk behaviors the relative importance of illegal unregulated and the legal and regulated wildlife trade in disease risk and improving understanding of the relationship between ecosystem degradation and restoration landscape structure and the risk of disease emergence Access the

I find I share this trait with others who have an association with this enchanting park Subjectivity and possessiveness are of course manifestations of ego But they also lead to identification of oneself with a place or an animal followed by commitment and action And commitment is what this countrys conservation effort needs most Kanha in many ways has moulded my life I first went to Mandla as a fiveyear old in 1943 where my maternal uncle Dr Nagendra Singh ICS was the collector On New Years day 1944 my parents promised to take me to the fabled place But when I woke up that morning they were gone I was inconsolable and vowed I will join the ICS become the collector of Mandla and retaliate by not taking them to Kanha I did join the IAS opted for Madhya Pradesh State and in 1967 for the first time in my career asked for a posting as collector Mandla and was given it That winter my parents came I took them to Kanha but this time they refused to take my wife who was then expecting our first child My wife and I agree that we spent the happiest three years of my career in that wonderful district with the house on the Narmada and Kanha as the lodestar Prior to my posting I had visited Kanha in 1963 and 1964 meeting George Schaller for the first time in a memorable situation As I drove into Hiran Chapar on a frosty December morning a tableau presented itself A barasingha stag in rut with his six hinds eyes riveted on a patch of grass were hysterically braying their alarm call Beyond in a jeep stood a lanky white man watching with binoculars My arrival disturbed the dramatis personae From the patch of grass emerged a tigress in her splendid ochreorange winter coat I still remember the look of chagrin and anguish on Georges face when our vehicles passed I had also seen my first Kanha tiger a large male whom the locals called Behra deaf for his nonchalance in the presence of man He walked a full kilometre ahead of my jeep waiting for my vehicle to catch up at road turnings stamping out the markings of a leopard that had walked the road earlier and defecating on the leopards droppings I filmed him eating the tender upper portions of Themeda triandra the only time I have photographed a tiger eating grass The central Indian barasingha Cervus duvauceli branderi is today restricted only to the meadows of Kanha in Madhya Pradesh Courtesy DRMKRanjitsinh The Barasingha Mystery A tragedy was imminent in Kanha in 1967 Schaller had counted only 82 barasingha in 1964 In his seminal work The Deer and the Tiger he had opined that brucellosis a contagious disease which causes abortion and is prevalent amongst livestock could be a cause of decline He only mentioned it as a possibility In 1968 I counted 66 barasingha and 72 in 1969 Poaching was not a problem and the cause of decline was mystifying The forest officials were inclined to accept brucellosis as the cause But livestock never came to the Kanha meadows where the barasingha were confined to and the latter never went out to where the livestock were Besides if indeed the Brucella parasite was present in the Kanha grassland it should affect all herbivores and not just the barasinhga The cause was evidently more complex It was suggested that the Kanha barasingha had become too inbred and fresh bloodline had to be imported Since the last survivors of the deer outside of Kanha in Bastar and Bilaspur districts and in the Khudrahi block in Mandla had recently been rendered extinct and the central Indian barasingha Cervus duvauceli branderi named after the remarkable authornaturalist Dunbar Brander who had been a DFO in Mandla survived now only in Kanha it was suggested that we capture and translocate specimens of the nominate race of the barasingha from Uttar Pradesh I opposed this move It is inappropriate to interbreed subspecies not just from the scientific standpoint but from the conservation viewpoint as well For if we intermingle subspecies the very argument for the conservation of endemic endangered taxa and indeed of biodiversity itself is nullified Besides I felt the subspecies could be saved and as long as there was a breeding pair there was hope Introduction of another subspecies could always be done later if our efforts failed to save the local one In the meanwhile urgent measures were required I proposed in the next meeting of the State Wildlife Advisory Board held in Kanha itself that the main objective of the management of Kanha was to save the barasingha and everything else was subsidiary This was accepted The first thing was to stop the baiting of tigers at Schaller Hide where George used to provide buffalo baits then quite permissible to study tigers Subsequently baiting continued and the site was a favourite point for visitors to view tigers It was the haunt of the tigress Lunti named after the first tiger I had ever seen in Dungarpur Rajasthan two decades earlier and of her family of two large playful cubs I had spent many a happy hour watching this family from the hide and from the back of the exuberant elephant Pawanmala playing hide and seek with the cubs Pawanmala enjoying the game as much as the cubs with the mother watching benignly without a growl One fullmoon and a bitterly cold night the tigress and cubs lay beside the kill after a huge meal Suddenly Lunti sat up and stared intently to the right of the hide Following her gaze I saw an apparition approaching My binoculars clearly showed it was Mussolini the resident alpha male so named because his protruding jowls surly temper and the habit of growling with neck characteristically thrust forward and upward reminded me of the Italian dictator in his harangues The cubs disappeared in the grass Lunti turned over on her back paws hanging limply Musso went and sniffed her anal area and then went to the kill to feed The tigress quietly got up and sat down between the feeding male and where the cubs had gone Soon the cubs reappeared and sat on one side of the clearing on their haunches Whereupon Lunti went and parked herself again between the tiger and her cubs Though Musso was the father of her cubs Lunti was taking no chances The problem was that during summer Schaller Hide then was the only spot between Shravan Tal and Kanha village which held permanent water and the barasingha thus always milled around this area In 1968 sixteen barasingha were killed by tigers all around Schaller Hide I conveyed to the State Wildlife Board that if such predation of the barasingha continued translocation of the tiger at least from the Kanha meadows would have to be considered From the winter of 1968 water was impounded in Desi Nala and baiting at Schaller Hide was stopped The visitors were deprived of seeing tigers at the site but the tiger kills of barasingha dropped to just one in 1969 No shifting of tigers was then necessary Several villages occupied the precincts of the Kanha Tiger Reserve until 1969 when Sonph became the first village to be voluntarily relocated from a national park in independent India after which 27 more villages followed This saw a considerable expansion of Kanhas wild space leading to a steady rise in wildlife numbers Courtesy DRMKRanjitsinh A Revival In 1969 an American couple came to Kanha and became lifelong friends another debt I owe to Kanha Fred Stoever donated 10000 with which we built a large stockade at Kanha and drove a small group of barasingha to breed and survive on the site in case the wild population did succumb The barasingha multiplied in the stockade and from there they were subsequently translocated for reintroduction into the Supkhar area of the park But the blackbuck which had inadvertently entered the stockade and survived have died out as has the population outside in the park and the local population of blackbuck tragically is now extinct in Kanha Subsequently blackbuck were captured in the neighbouring Seoni district and reintroduced in the Kanha meadows It was evident that with repeated burning of the grass which attracted the chital for the fresh flush of green grass that ensued but which deprived the barasingha of high grass for fawning was unsuitable for the deer And they had no other meadows to go to outside the central Kanha meadows at that point of time Sonph and Raunda meadows were occupied by villages Across the Maikal Range and the boundary of Mandla district lay the adjacent Balaghat District forests of Mukki Range where too the grass meadows had been occupied by forest villages In 1969 Sonph village of 84 households cultivating an area of 880 acres in the Sonph meadow but having an ecological impact over an area of about 20 sq km was persuaded to shift to a site outside the park Each farmer got one and half times the land he cultivated in Sonph which was tractorized and cleared for cultivation Free agricultural implements seed and draught animals were given The site had been chosen by the villagers themselves as was the site for the new village A school was built and wells dug and each villager chose where he wanted to build his house for which building material was supplied free They were given transport to shift all their belongings and wood from the old houses They went within a week and a week later a tiger came and killed a decrepit buffalo they had been left behind in what was the main street of Sonph Two months later in the monsoon the barasingha moved into the now empty meadow and gave birth to fawns in the new high grass Animals were claiming back their lost grounds Sonph was the first village to be relocated outside a national park in independent India Later 27 more villages were moved out of an enlarged Kanha and Kanha is what it is today because of this lebensraum living space for wildlife The barasingha count gradually increased to over 400 Later it was to become the state animal of Madhya Pradesh In the end it was concluded that it was the loss of suitable grassland habitat and fawning ground not disease that was responsible for the decline of the barasingha Courtesy DRMKRanjitsinh Blackbuck have also had a murky past in Kanha The species went locally extinct after which reintroduction from the nearby Seoni district followed Courtesy DRMKRanjitsinh In 1970 a young Swiss research scholar came for his dissertation on the barasingha and established that it was the ecological factor of loss of suitable grassland habitat and fawning ground and not disease that was the cause of the decline of the barasingha The young scholar Claude Martin was later to become head of World Wildlife Fund International Atop the Bamni Dadar plateau the only area in Kanha where one can spot the unique fourhorned antelope endemic to India is one of my favourite spots in the park The viewpoint commanding the vast vista of Balaghat forests with the large meadows once occupied by forest villages Bisanpura Ghorela Sondhar and others Once the habitat of barasingha human occupation of these grasslands had eradicated the only ecosystem niche to which they were adapted to In the Mandla part of Kanha apart from the central meadows only two sizeable meadows could be evacuated for this dying deer Sonph and Raunda But on the Balaghat side of the Maikal Range 18 meadows existed in the Mukki Range and more in Supkhar On the authors insistence the baiting of tigers at Schaller Hide was stopped in 1968 This saw fewer barasingha being hunted by tigers in the area Courtesy DRMKRanjitsinh Protecting Kanha For Posterity In 1969 I persuaded my counterpart the collector of Balaghat to send me a proposal for the extension of Kanha National Park over the adjacent Balaghat forests and which I could forward with my recommendation for the same to the state government in Bhopal The proposal came with the mandatory note from his Divisional Forest Officer DFO also recommending the extension but with the caveat that there were only nine tigers in the area in question but whose annual revenue from forestry operations was Rs 45 lakhs on an average and which would have to be given up The implication was that the State Government would have to sacrifice five lakhs per annum per tiger and five lakhs was a lot of money in 1969 Obviously the DFO did not want the park boundary extended though in deference to his collectors wishes he had recommended the extension There was no help for it I sent the proposal to Bhopal where it languished in the office of the Chief Conservator of Forests for over a year In 1970 I was transferred to Bhopal and posted as a Deputy Secretary in the Department of Finance After some prodding the proposal moved from the Chief Conservators office to the Forest Department in the State Secretariat and from there since it required a waiver of Rs 45 lakhs per annum to the Department of Finance The Finance Secretary my boss was an outstanding officer RN Malhotra subsequently to rise to be the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Madhya Pradesh was an impoverished state whose main revenue was from forests One day when Shri Malhotra was in a very upbeat mood I took the Kanha file to him and begged Please sign this sir for my sake He read the file and fixed me with his quizzical staresmile Give up five lakhs a year on an annual basis for each living tiger while we are charging a royalty of Rs 250 for each tiger we allow to be shot outside the park Tiger hunting in India came to a stop only in 1972 Yes Sir but there are more than nine tigers in the area I promise you and the forests are magnificent and the barasingha will go extinct if we dont extend I replied He stared some more smiled and signed I wish to dedicate this article to the memory of late RN Malhotra Kanha continues to impact my life and career In 1969 the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN held its epochmaking conference in Delhi and from which emerged Project Tiger Prior to the conference an IUCN team led by Dr Kai CurryLindahl visited Kanha Later Kai was responsible for my recruitment to the United Nations Environment Programme The legendary Sir Peter Scott also came to Kanha then With him I saw a large python mauled by the Chuhri tigress immobile but alive Subsequently I became Sir Peters ViceChairman in the Survival Service Commission of the IUCN In 1983 I guided HRH the Duke of Edinburghs visit to Kanha Apart from four tigers we saw wild dogs pull down a barasingha hind The Duke has kindly written a forward to my book Beyond the Tiger It was perhaps my stint in Kanha that prompted Mrs Indira Gandhi to appoint me Deputy Secretary in charge of wildlife in the Government of India in 1971 A LIFELONG LOVE Kanha is a kaleidoscope of memories of nine tigers seen in one morning five of which were adults of over 3000 chital massed on Hiran Chapar in early July the most magical time to be in Kanha after the first monsoonal showers interspersed with gaur blackbuck and barsingha with Sonu Baiga simulating a tiger the skin of the recently dead Lunti tied to his back and recording the cacophony of alarm calls that were emanating of playing back the rutting call of the greatest barasingha stag of my time the 22 pointer Maikal and getting an immediate response of counter belligerence of watching a tigress squatting two metres from my jeep for over 10 minutes and counting her whiskers of photographing a charging tigress over a distance of 40 m till Pawanmala our elephant sprayed her with dust from a distance of three metres of dawns in mistshrouded meadows with apparitions of barasingha stags braying their rutting calls antlers festooned with grass of sparring gaur bulls at Shravan Tal circling each other and venting their absurdly lowmuted rutting calls as they ritualistically raised their heads of wild dogs coursing and pulling down a chital stag to be joined by jackals and both canids feeding side by side of being charged by a pair of mating sloth bears on Macha Dadar two of the only three bears I have ever seen in Kanha of watching a tigress play with her fourmonthold cub on a bright December evening and coming upon the cubs mangled carcass the next morning the work of a transient male of seeing a Lesser Florican the only record in that part of the country in two consecutive years in July on Kanheri Maidan of watching withDr S\u00e1lim Ali a male tiger on Nakti Ghati steadfastly looking away with nary a look back for over 20 minutes and the old man remarking Rude isnt he In 1972 I had gone to Kanha with the purpose of including it as a tiger reserve under Project Tiger Shri H S Panwar the dynamic park Director and later the Director of Project Tiger and I watched the tigress Short Tail and her two almost fullgrown cubs Short Tail had only a 50 cm tail As a cub the tail vertebrae had broken and festered and she herself had bitten her tail off I had known her and her family for almost five years Next morning Short Tail was with an adult young male who sported a gaping fresh wound on his forehead which ShortTail was constantly licking The two cubs that day were bedded not near the mother but some 60 m away and only the female cub came to visit the mother and the new entrant Normally a very tolerant tigress Short Tail was very surly that morning not allowing close approach on elephant back But I did succeed in taking pictures of the wounded young male which on enlarging later I found to be Short Tails own progeny of the previous litter Facial markings of a tiger do not change and there was no doubt about his identity The adult male had come to his mother to care for a wound his own tongue could not reach and the mother had obliged I shall always return to Kanha My daughters will throw my ashes on the Kanha meadows and immerse some in the Shravan Tal if the park authorities permit An elusive barking deer or the muntjac foraging in Kanha The authors legendary conservation efforts have helped in improving the protection and management of the park making it a crucial wildlife stronghold in Central India and one of the finest national parks in the country Courtesy DRMKRanjitsinh join the conversation

memorykeeper and nature messenger for tomorrow he was awarded Sanctuarys Lifetime Service Award 2020 for propagating nature conservation all his life He retired as Chief Postmaster General of Tamil Nadu and as a prolific author in Tamil he brings conservation to people in their own language A longtime association with WWFIndia saw him serving two terms as a Trustee and he also served as the South India representative of the International Primate Protection League At the young age of 81 he spoke with longtime friend Bittu Sahgal about his life his passion for writing and constant effort to inspire the young to trust in and nurture nature Theodore I love your moustache Does it have a story Oh yes It does In 1996 I visited a farm near Rajkot which had a prize Gir bull My idea was to photograph it for a series of stamps on indigenous breeds of cattle Vasa a 72yearold farmer who had a strong athletic build was in charge of the bull I spent a day with him saw him handle the animal which was almost like a small elephant I was so impressed that I wanted to pay a tribute to him I started growing a moustache like his But mine is not as glorious as his typical Saurashtrian moonch You were born in Dharapuram But where did you grow up Tell us a little about your family Yes Dharapuram a village by the river Amravati which originates in the Palani ranges of the Western Ghats On a clear cloudless day you can see the majestic ranges in the northern horizon Dharapuram means the land of the immortals It has a perennial river named after Tara the Buddhist Yakshini In fact there are nearly six places in India bearing that name including Tarapur in Maharashtra My parents were schoolteachers and we were poor I shared my childhood with two sisters and two brothers and our parents gave us the freedom to choose who we wished to be what we wanted to study They were emancipated Most of our time was spent outdoors by the river swimming in the farm wells and on trees I wish children today could experience such a life I remember once rescuing a jungle cat kitten from a well and handrearing it Nature was part and parcel of our lives We knew which snakes to avoid and which birds and animals lived around us That is how I developed a bond with the natural world The night sky was full of stars and the milky way could clearly be seen On moonlit nights we played hide and seek I had a wonderful childhood Baskaran with his parents Photo courtesy Theodore Baskaran So how come a history honours student from Madras Christian College turned into one of Indias quietest most persistent wildlife defenders The Madras Christian College campus a 400acre scrub jungle supported an amazing diversity of wildlife including birds small monitor lizards jackals and more Our college had a birdwatching society and I once signed up for a trip to the Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary that had been organised by Dr Joshua our Zoology professor He introduced me to what he called The Book Salim Alis Book of Indian Birds We had single rooms in our hostel and that facilitated reading thinking and individualism History and wildlife This regimentation of knowledge is very artificial done for the purpose of studying Otherwise everything is interrelated Much later you even taught Film Studies Will digital media be the ultimate archival tool for generations to come After my retirement I worked as a Director of Roja Muthiah Research Library Chennai for three years and this is when I got familiar with digital archiving particularly Tamil studies The future of archiving is certainly digital but there may be questions For instance we no longer use so many technologies that were relevant even a few years ago like the CD Clearly as technology advances so will our archiving strategies But I think many archivists will still swear by microfilm or ordinary film The importance of history is neither understood nor appreciated What is memory to an individual history is to mankind All our chronic problems have their roots in history Does todays generation know enough about our past history and is history really relevant to their lives tomorrow The answer to the first question is a definite no In many colleges in the last 40 years history has been discounted I am connected with some educational institutions and I see that the importance of history is neither understood nor appreciated What is memory to an individual history is to mankind All our chronic problems have their roots in history Kashmir Northeast even Palestine Unless one has a good understanding of history they will swallow propagandist history Just look at the way the memory of Tipu Sultan has been twisted Theodore and Thilaka in Kodaikanal Together they are a force to reckon with organising nature camps and trails for hundreds of children Photo courtesy Theodore Baskaran What about the Bangladesh War of 1972 How were you involved in this Earlier Post and Telegraph was one Department and I was posted as the Vigilance Officer in Shillong in charge of this combined department One of its responsibilities during the war was to lay telephone and telegraph cables on the front and I was designated as Officer on Special Duty for War Efforts and travelled to the conflict front I remember once during the Bangladesh War I was in Agartala having dinner with the Deputy Commissioner Mr Lyngdho who later became our Election Commissioner and we could hear the whining of shells as they flew right above us There goes another one he would say and continue eating The short assignment was an interesting period In Shillong we had trenches in front of our house Twice we watched a dogfight between two aircrafts over the city You retired as Chief Postmaster General How did Government service and conservation meet up I look back on my years in civil service with a great sense of satisfaction I had a lot of freedom In government service time is not money That left people like me time to devote to our interests Of course when a new assignment turned up then for a month or two the schedule got tight Essentially with most government jobs one is left with enough free time to pursue passions And when Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi introduced the fivedayweek life got even better The weekends were mine I was posted to various parts of the country the Northeast Gujarat Bengal and I got to know both the people and wildlife havens across India In 1985 I did a oneyear course at the National Defence College and that carried me to Mauritius and the USSR I also undertook a twomonth course in Japan and in 1996 got a United Nations assignment in Kenya where my wildlife dreams came true For all this and more I am grateful to Civil Service for giving me freedom security and opportunities Theodore authored a comprehensive handbook on Indian dog breeds in 2017 Four of Baskarans photos of them were released as stamps Photo courtesy Theodore Baskaran Who were your major influences I got to know M Krishnan after I left college I asked him what I should do to learn about birds Read Douglas Dewar he pronounced like an oracle I was greatly influenced by his ideas on nature conservation and India He was an honest man a rationalist and had a very sharp mind He truly did not care for money and status I loved his writing He was very good in Tamil too After I retired I searched for found and collected his Tamil articles most of them written in the 40s and 50s and published as Monsoon and the Call of the Koel Later along with friend Rangarajan I edited about 100 of his English articles compiled into My Native Land I am also in awe of the writings of nature writer Peter Matthiessen known for his book The Snow Leopard Matthiessen developed a style of nature writing that made thousands across the world pause to look at the wild world with all its life forms and wonders In Madras in the 1970s I began to listen to J Krishnamurthy every winter when he visited the city His perception of life appealed to me particularly about nature In his words Can you have a feeling for a tree look at it see the beauty of it listen to the sound it makes Can you be sensitive to the little plant a little weed to that creeper growing up the wall to the light on the leaves and the many shadows In 1997 I attended a fourday retreat in Madras conducted by Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh That opened new vistas for me I often go back to his books particularly Being Peace which speaks about recovering our own sovereignty I wish children today could experience such a life I remember once rescuing a jungle cat kitten from a well and handrearing it Nature was part of our lives You are fortunate to have mind and heart in sync Theodore You also played a major role in bringing the public into the wildlife conservation discourse with WWFIndia right My connection with WWF began in 1980 when a few of us in Coimbatore started to organise film screenings exhibitions and lectures My wife Thilaka and I conducted nature camps for students under the WWF banner and was eventually nominated as a trustee for two terms I got to know people like Divyabhanusinh and gained knowledge on conservation from a national perspective And the International Primate Protection League Yes while travelling in Mizoram in 1970 I saw a troupe of Hoolock gibbons I wrote a short note about what I had observed in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society I hardly knew anything about primates but the note attracted the attention of the International Primate Protection League IPPL in North Carolina They wanted me to be their South Indian Representative I went on to hold that position for 10 long years I wrote in the Newsletter of the IPPL about the plight of the liontailed macaques and the export of bonnet macaques for laboratory purposes which had been banned when the late Morarji Desai was Indias Prime Minister Theodore has written on several subjects aside from conservation art history films in both English and Tamil He harbours a fondness for the latter as he believes discussions need to be had in the local language to be effective Your great passion has been to take conservation to the people in their own language right In Chennai the estuary of the Adyar river has very productive mud flats that attract thousands of migrant birds including flamingos every winter Twenty years ago suddenly one day the estuary was dredged to facilitate boating Overnight a unique habitat was destroyed But nobody seemed to notice That was when I realised that all the discourse on conservation and wildlife was being carried on in English and was missing the real targets I understood how critical it was for Tamil to be the language of discourse and discussion This is what motivated me to write in Tamil on issues surrounding nature conservation In rural areas people live much closer to wildlife than city dwellers and it is vital for this discussion to be held in their language in this case Tamil Think of the Save Silent Valley movement It was successful largely because the entire discourse was in Malayalam David Crystal the linguist said in his book Language Death The twoway relation of languages to ecology needs to be developed While discussing ecological issues languages need to become part of the agenda If we want concern about the environment to spread like literacy then we must begin from elementary schools in local languages All the traditional knowledge of the world is couched in local languages That is the umbilical cord The added problem here is that most wildlife biologists are English speaking and largely unfamiliar with local languages and the nomenclatures I see that as a handicap in their field work You were awarded the Iyal Virudhu by the Canada Literary Garden This outfit is run by the Tamil diaspora and they choose one Tamil writer for the Iyal award Iyal means prose I was given the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014 This is a recognition I greatly cherish because it was given for my nature writing in Tamil Thilaka and I travelled to Toronto to receive this from the hands of Ms Radhika a Tamil MP in the Parliament of Canada What a rich life You have also lectured overseas and are very active today What drives you I am interested in what I am doing wildlife education Tamil writing and that provides meaning to my life I have never once been bored in my entire life If you had one piece of advice to give to young India what might that be Look around and get interested in the external world and all the life forms in it Your life will be

The project focuses on those individuals whose conservation leadership potential is overlooked by large organisations and government agencies because of limitations such as the lack of academic qualifications access to technology or language barriers Through this project Sanctuary is enabling a network of onground conservationists across the country each of whom is contributing steadfastly to biodiversity conservation and community engagement in distinct and measurable ways In addition to monetary support Sanctuary works to raise the profiles of these Project Leaders connect them to pertinent organisations or experts and forward their causes The Project has been developed to be flexible to the needs of each Project Leader and Sanctuarys support to each one is customised While keeping paperwork and bureaucracy to a minimum Sanctuary ensures that every project develops holistically Selection Project Leaders are selected through a closed nomination process Nominations are invited from trusted conservationists within Sanctuarys extensive network and are reviewed by the Sanctuary team Priority is given to nominees who do not have the tools to expand their work through external funding and are working in neglected landscapes on conflict mitigation or on community engagement Nominations for the Mud on Boots Project are considered on a rolling basis as and when funds become available The sponsorship of a single Project Leaders work is INR 300000 for the two years This excludes administration costs and overhead Photo Shiv Kumar Current Project Leaders Bhumika Yadav

technology and a much greater appetite among the young for books to remind them of the wonderful biosphere in which they live it is heartening to see how many new highquality publications are emerging from within India Here are books that Sanctuary believes should be in every public library and in the homes of all those whose hearts beat to natures drum The Story of Indias Cheetahs By Divyabhanusinh Published by The Marg Foundation Hardcover 322 pages \u00e2\u00b9 2800 The cheetah has recaptured our attention in the past year when India undertook the ambitious project of introducing the species The outcome of the project notwithstanding I was definitely curious about the life and disappearance of the feline in India And Divyabhanusinhs book could not have come at a more opportune moment The book travels through time as the author unveils the life of the cheetah in India from 2300 BCE as portrayed in jagged prehistoric paintings in cave shelters to travelling on carts for hunting expeditions and to being reduced to skins as the result of shikar About 30 years ago in 1995 Divyabhanusinh a conservationist who has championed disappearing wild species authored The End of a Trail The Cheetah in India an exhaustive book about the species in the country The Story of Indias Cheetahs is a revision and update of the text of his first work to include the cheetah introduction programme Divyabhanusinh a close associate of Sanctuary Asia has been the President of WWFIndia and a member of different national and international bodies for wildlife such as the IUCNs Cat Specialist Group He was also a part of the Cheetah Task Force when it was constituted by then Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh when the reintroduction of the cheetah was discussed in 2009 The book delves deep into the life of cheetahs in different geographies cultures languages and texts across different periods in India This is a book for wildlife as well as history buffs Along with the text the book is studded with plates of cheetahs represented in fine art miniatures painted during the reign of the Mughals A particularly impressive recreation in the book is one of a painting dating back to 1570 attributed to Indian miniature painter Bas\u00c4wan This depicts a cheetah family with two adult felines and four cubs in a rocky landscape under a towering tree This is said to be the earliest record of the cheetah in the wild in India The Mughal Emperor Akbar is known to have kept 1000 cheetahs in his stable and is believed to have possessed as many as 9000 over the five decades of his rule The section on British rule in India is the proverbial smoking gun detailing the lengths to which they went to enjoy a pastime they could not find at home The author also notes the explosion in documentation of the cheetahs from numerous accounts of shikar to art and naturalists observations Several cheetahs were also shipped to Britain Additionally the author painstakingly records the last few sightings of the cheetah in India And when was the very last of these wild cats spotted in our country Read the book to find out The extensive records of shikar help understand the historical range of the cheetah its prey its hunting style its interactions with humans and other animals The Mughal practice of trapping and training cheetahs for hunts has generated a wealth of information on the cat An entire chapter is dedicated to such manuals which also include illustrations highlighting the relationship between people and cheetahs The author ruefully points out that modern Indian zoos seem to have learnt nothing from the old management traditions The author dismisses other theories about the cheetah including the one that all cheetahs in India were brought from Africa with documentation from across the centuries After presenting historical evidence in relation to humans the author leaps into the biology of the cheetah and its lineage Employing genome analysis studies of skulls and skins and other techniques he highlights how closely related different cheetahs are to establish whether African cheetahs couldshould be introduced in India In the last chapter the author discusses the rationale and prospect of introducing cheetahs in India Since the 1950s when the administration realised that the cheetah was in danger discussions on initially preserving and then by the 1970s introducing cheetahs have been ongoing The current programme of cheetah introduction moved forward in fits and starts from 2009 with many twists and turns in the form of court orders and several stakeholders The book goes on to explain just how it came to fruition including the controversy surrounding it One overarching point made by the National Tiger Conservation Authority presented by the author is that the reintroductionrestoration of a flagship species such as the cheetah is an ecosystem restoration programme in much the same way as the protection of the onehorned rhino ensured the survival of Kazirangas grasslands or the way the protection of the Asiatic lion helped protect the scrub grasslands of Gir Reviewed by Shatakshi Gawade join the

Kerala by Anoop NR and T Ganesh W ayanad is a gentle eastsloping plateau that merges with the drier Mysore plateau in the east Peppered with rich lowlying swamps and meandering streams the north Kerala district remains a heavily forested district despite experiencing largescale landcover change during colonial rule The migration of people from Travancore in southern Kerala after World War II inevitably led to forests and wetlands being wiped out to address the food crisis As a result Wayanad forests were fragmented into two narrow tracts along their western and eastern borders see map below The western forest belt is mostly evergreen and highly fragmented while the eastern forest belt is deciduous and connected to the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve NBR a globally important conservation area Wayanad plateau offers a unique geography of small emergent hills interspersed with slushy swamps During summers when the carrying capacity of adjoining dry forests in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu reduces Wayanad with its vayals swamps and perennial water sources becomes the key micohabitat for elephants and other large herbivores However these forests are highly vulnerable to rampant humancaused fires that wreak havoc across the habitat and intensify humanwildlife conflict in the region Despite the adverse consequences for both wildlife and people few studies have delved into the impact of fires on the NBR ecosystem In February 2019 my field assistant Chandran and I were in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary sampling elephant dung as part of my PhD work on the ecology of Asian elephants In the afternoon we received a message from a friend warning us to refrain from sampling in Vadakkanad village where people had allegedly started a fire in the forest In the following two days fires were started in six different sites near the village destroying about 60 hectares of forest We approached a forest department official who wishes to remain anonymous to understand why this was happening He told us The fire was intentionally started because of the animosity of villagers towards the forest department which was unable to capture a bull elephant locally known as the Vadakkanad Komban and had been noted to persistently raid crops in the area Burning the forest was a form of protest against the Forest Department and the elephant Forests and Fires the Aftermath Tree cover abundant leaf litter and humus in the soil work together to allow the percolation of water during rainfall and moist weather This is vital to sustain streams and vayals during the summers Fires can adversely affect percolation trigger soil erosion and dry up water bodies The unavailability of water can severely affect forest dynamics leading larger numbers of animals to encounter one another at scattered water resources At the height of dry season this large bull spend hours in the swamps due to the availability of shade water slush forage and unique microclimate A herd of elephants forage in the high altitude grasslands of Brahmagiris Invasive species like Lantana camara and Senna spectabilis tend to spread widely across fireravaged and degraded areas hindering the growth of native vegetation and accumulating biomass that can further fuel future fires creating a positive feedback loop Such species are nonpalatable for herbivores and can have serious implications on the fitness of megaherbivores like elephants which consume vegetation in huge quantities In the absence of their natural diet elephants may leave the forests in search of food leading to conflict situations with people There is growing evidence in Wayanad that Lantana camara can be wiped out from the forests if fires are prevented from sweeping across the landscape frequently allowing regeneration of native vegetation This has been observed in the Pazhupathur section of Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary Chethalayam Range and Ondayanagadi Reserve Forests in the North Wayanad Forest Division where consistent monitoring of fires has done wonders for the health of the forest The vegetation of any healthy forest emerges in several layers with different plants growing to varying heights and sizes But if you walk through the deciduous forests of NBR you are likely to find only tall trees on account of the high mortality of seedlings and saplings after fires The undergrowth in these forests are mainly dominated by Lantana camara Uncontrolled fires can cause the total devastation of some species due to their ecological and evolutionary peculiarities The fire also kills trees that are weak or not welladapted to fire Bamboo is common in the Wayanad forests and is important for maintaining the microclimate and providing food for elephants Gregarious flowering of bamboo Bamboosa sp occurs every 4050 years and the plant dies after producing seeds Fires during the flowering and fruiting season can destroy the seed bank devastating the entire population of the plant This was observed during the mass flowering of bamboo in Begur forest range from 2008 to 2010 leading to poor regeneration of bamboo among other species Fires and Conflict the Link Humanelephant conflict HEC majorly affects local support for biodiversity conservation Our study on HEC in Wayanad revealed that conflict has escalated over time and tolerance of people has reduced Many of Wayanads wetlands are increasingly being wiped out for growing paddy in the last century Frequent fires and widespread urbanisation have left a scarcity of food in forests leading elephants to venture out onto paddy fields A farmer from Vadakkanad said There was no elephant problem when I bought this land in the late 1960s It was very fertile allowing us to cultivate varied cash and food crops During this time elephants were afraid of us they would run away when they saw us Guns were common and there was no restriction on using them to hunt wildlife or drive elephants away Now elephants and other wildlife frequently enter our lands and we dont know what to do I think this is happening because of rising wildlife populations loss of fear of people unavailability of food and water inside the forest owing to expanding teak plantations and invasive species Corruption and apathy too impact conflict resolution The Forest Department rushes to the scene when a tiger or elephant has died or if there is a fire but does not come to our rescue These forests are already heavily fragmented and degraded due to various anthropogenic pressures and unmonitored fires can only further deteriorate their condition Conflict in the region can be expected to escalate further if forage becomes increasingly unavailable to wildlife a situation only worsened by the spread of invasive species and water shortages An Urgent Ecorestoration Plan Wayanads rich biodiverse forests are important for the survival of not only its wildlife but also its people We must come up with efficient strategies to manage the remaining vegetation and restore degraded parts of the forest and rewild monoculture plantations An urgent ecorestoration programme needs to be devised for the landscape involving local communities who must be made aware of the issues It is obvious that urgent solutions that focus on wildlife conservation awareness among locals as well as sustainable successful solutions that protect crops and livestock from wild animals is key to ensuring that locals are not antagonistic to wildlife conservation Currently pursuing his PhD on the ecology of Asian elephants at Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment ATREE Anoop NR is actively involved in biodiversity conservation in the Wayanad plateau in Kerala and hopes his doctoral research will contribute to the protection of elephants and the wellbeing of rural communities A senior fellow at ATREE T Ganesh works to understand how wild species and their ecosystems adapt to natural and anthropogenic changes

unearthing natural history knowledge building conservation strategies and shaping communities Dr Vibhu Prakash Scientist conservationist and species protector Dr Vibhu Prakashs also see page 36 name is synonymous with vulture conservation in India Stories from his childhood and youth contain some clues to his remarkable 40year journey of studying and conserving raptors in the country A shy boy in Meerut who preferred the company of the plants and animals he encountered on his solo adventures outdoors he was always encouraged by his mother to read books and articles on nature and was particularly influenced by the writings of Jim Corbett While he was a graduate student in the 1970s he enjoyed birding along the Abu Nallah a large drain that flowed through Meerut city One day he spotted a huge flock of European Starlings and unable to identify them he bought The Book of Indian Birds by Dr S\u00e1lim Ali but he didnt find the birds within those pages either Puzzled he wrote to the celebrated ornithologist and was pleasantly surprised to receive a response That was the beginning of his correspondence with the iconic Indian naturalist After graduation he decided to apply to the Bombay Natural History Society and got the job His first posting at Point Calimere Tamil Nadu laid the foundation for his lifelong interest in raptors In the early 80s he began working on his PhD at the Keoladeo Ghana National Park Bharatpur Rajasthan meticulously observing various species of raptors and recording their population changes and nesting performance over the years He was awarded a PhD degree by Mumbai University in 1990 In the early 90s Dr Vibhu Prakash and his team continued gathering data on vulture populations across national parks If not for their constant monitoring the sharp decline in numbers would have gone unnoticed Racing against the clock he and his colleagues initiated the vulture recovery programme which became the guiding force for the Indian governments response to the situation He was involved in setting up the internationally acclaimed Vulture Conservation Breeding Programme with centres in Pinjore Haryana Buxa West Bengal Rani Assam and in Bhopal Madhya Pradesh Today these centres manage more than 800 vultures Additionally 344 hatchlings have been successfully reared This has been primarily instrumental in the recovery of three Gyps vulture species the Whitebacked G bengalensis Longbilled G indicus and Slenderbilled G tenuirostris Dr Prakash played an instrumental role in the banning of veterinary use of diclofenac the drug that caused the decline in vultures With over four decades of raptor studies and vulture conservation behind him he continues his vital work in the field Today he is a PhD guide for students at the Mumbai University His wife Nikita works shoulder to shoulder with him at Conservation Breeding Centres and his two sons Rishabh and Saurabh though engineers by profession are very keen on raptors too Dr Prakash has been the Deputy Director and Principal Scientist of the Bombay Natural History Society since June 1995 He serves on various national and international committees organisations and groups regarding the protection of raptors in general and vultures in particular Besides which he has also been extensively featured in various renowned media platforms Dr Prakash is a national treasure as valuable to conservation science as our raptors are to our ecosystems For his lifes work of pioneering scientific research and timely incisive conservation efforts to protect our vultures we honour

August 2021 I spent a wonderful morning working with an underwater robot in an abandoned quarry Over the Goan monsoon water accumulates quickly and this particular pit now hosted a still teal pool Over 10 m deep in parts and empty of other people at this time of day it was the ideal location for our mornings practice of running transects and conducting precision control Once we were done we jumped into the pool for a quick swim At the far end of the pool near a small waterfall we spotted a pair of Common Kingfishers and a baby monitor lizard Curious but not startled they watched us approach and let us observe them for a few minutes before they went on with their day This wasnt quite the typical workday for me but neither was it completely out of the ordinary I work at the intersection of technology and conservation at Technology for Wildlife TfW an organisation that I founded in 2017 Our morning at the quarry among other similar excursions provides us with the information we need to develop techniques for the appropriate use of robots for conservation Our mission at TfW is to amplify conservation impact through the appropriate use of modern technology The author uses a submersible robot to explore the highaltitude Tso Kar lake in Ladakh The use of such gear helps heighten our understanding of wild habitats that may be impossible to traverse on foot Photo Technology for Wildlife Foundation Technology the art and craft of creating processes and tools to solve problems has been an essential component of Homo sapiens ascent to global supremacy but in recent centuries it has come with costs that we are only just beginning to comprehend and pay At the global scale humaninduced greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change but the internal combustion engine has been an essential part of the human growth story A more relatable perspective light pollution harms insect diversity with cascading impacts on food security but we know that electrification and access to light especially in India improves health and educational outcomes which are both essential components of poverty alleviation Development is good and technology amplifies development Abandoning all technology and returning to a mythical Golden Past is neither practicable nor an equitable solution It will only benefit those who are able to bear the costs of doing so and further divides humanity along the lines of privilege If all our tools are doubleedged swords how do we avoid harming ourselves when we use them I believe the solution is to sharpen the edge we wish to use and to dull the one that can cut us We need to use technology with the clear intention of shaping our collective future for the better It is essential that this is accompanied by an understanding that the world will change as a result of our actions The mindless and inappropriate use of technology as of anything else is unnecessarily harmful An aerial image of mangroves in Salvador do Mundo and Chorao island in Goa taken using a drone The author believes that mindful and strategic use of technology will help secure the future of our wildlife Photo Technology for Wildlife Foundation This is critically important in the context of our culturally and biologically diverse country The ripples caused by our actions can have consequences beyond our comprehending ability While this is true for all technology it is especially important when using technology for wildlife and environmental conservation For example electric fencing has been a valuable tool for the mitigation of humanwildlife conflict but they need to be deployed fairly and strategically Unplanned placement can result in the death of wildlife and the destruction of wildlife corridors while inequitable allocation further exacerbates existing social inequalities Another example camera traps have been used successfully to estimate wildlife populations in India aiding in better conservation planning but they simultaneously impact the ability of local communities to navigate their forests Conservation practices that do not respect human sentiments will not succeed more importantly conservation that is not inclusive and intersectional has no place in our world today To paraphrase Kentaro Toyama technology only amplifies human intent and capacity it does not alter it If the intentions for Indian conservation are exclusionary or fortressbased our technology can make that a reality to our eventual collective and total detriment A relevant quote to insert here by William Gibson The future is already here its just not evenly distributed yet As humanity kicks and screams its way through the 21 st century our role as humans and conservationists should be to ensure that

one of Indias first tiger habitats Palamau Tiger Reserve PTR according to All India Tiger Estimation AITE 2018 report reads a headline in a national daily But what now The tigers seem to have disappeared from these forests I ask my Baiga friend He responds in a grave tone They must have gone antardhyaan disguised as invisible they must be there somewhere He thinks for a while and mutters Bagh nahin hoga toh phir jungle hi kaise kehlaaya How can one even call this a jungle then if there is no tiger According to noted anthropologist Raymond Hames If a people have a conservationist ideology but do not act as conservationists they are not conservationists How a hunter feels about the deer he hunts and how those feelings may have been engendered by his religion are interesting psychological questions But the hunters actual treatment of the deer is the only thing that matters 1 Despite what my Baiga friend felt about the tiger the carnivore and more so its prey have been hunted out in the area Tigers and other wildlife are intertwined with faith folklore and myths of Adivasis That is where they still live on Palamaus case is not an isolated one Palamau is an ecological and social microcosm of Jharkhand in particular and eastcentral India in general The eastcentral Indian landscape includes forests of eastern Uttar Pradesh Mirzapur Chandauli and Sonbhadra districts southern Bihar KaimurBhabhua Rohtas Aurangabad Gaya Nawada Jamui and Munger districts Chotanagpur Plateau ie Jharkhand and western districts of West Bengal Odisha Chhattisgarh Gadhchiroli district Maharashtra northern Telangana Warangal Adilabad Khammam and Karimnagar districts and the Agency Tract Areas of northeastern Andhra Pradesh Large contiguous tracts of forests span these state borders These were once famed for tigers and other wildlife large and small Many indigenous communities with distinctive cultures and overlapping in spatial location also live here There are 32 Scheduled Tribes in Jharkhand 42 in Chhattisgarh 62 in Odisha 32 in Telangana The eastcentral Indian landscape has a long history of conflicts and tribal assertions over Jal Jangal Zameen Water Forest and Land This slogan critical to the Jharkhand movement continues to resonate in many parts of Jharkhand Chhattisgarh and Odisha However in these debates over Jal Jangal Zameen Jaanwar wildlife or animals have always been conspicuously absent This omission is unfortunate because while the unfinished contests over Jal Jangal Zameen continue many faunal species have either already vanished or soon will across this landscape Map of EastCentral Indian Landscape including all the locations named in the essay For a full highresolution PDF version of the map click here The tigers ecological position as an umbrella predator species makes it a major indicator of the ecosystems health Tiger numbers have fallen steeply across eastcentral India since the first allIndia tiger census in 1972 The 2018 estimates confirmed a crash in numbers across these forests Functionally extinct in Jharkhand tigers are nearextinct in Chhattisgarh and Odisha Unlike local extinctions in Panna 2 or Sariska 3 which were a result of selective poaching these collapses of tigers copredators and multiple ungulate and other mammalian species have gone unnoticed by most wildlife groups biologists and the media Similarly vigorous movements for peoples rights here have also ignored extinctions of these animals long integral to local cultures as much as to the overall ecologies These silences over the vanishing calls for critical reflection This is all the more so as communitybased conservation has many adherents over the last three decades 4 and there are critical debates around its realisation Some activists and commentators even label indigenous communities as natural conservationists born conservationists best conservationists and natural protectors of wildlife 5 But are either the votaries or even critical voices cognizant of the ground realities Wild animals and forests are common cultural threads that tie together disparate Adivasi groups of eastcentral India Among the two forests arguably are much more important to them This is because apart from their cultural and spiritual importance forests are central to their economies Forests provide them with grazing grounds for cattle water for fields livelihood via nonwood produce like Tendu and Mahua firewood additional food security and traditional medicine Finally it is a space for recreation which includes hunting On the other hand wild animals especially tigers are often part of the origin legends of many of these communities Wildlife iconography in the form of totem animals are bedrocks of clanbased divisions This totemistic differentiation governs many specific social and cultural norms of interclan and outside interaction These cultural relationships and the historic cohabitation of wildlife in the same landscapes can easily lead one to surmise that coexistence is the norm But can we equate coutilisation or cohabitation with conservation Such simple readings often ignore the evidence on ground Developments in recent decades have drastically altered lifestyles for remote forest communities from the rise of settled agriculture and sedentary living to the proliferation of mutton and cheap broiler chicken as a replacement for game meat There is an increasing integration of village communities with outside market forces due to increased allweather road penetration expansion of cell phone network televisions provision of electricity either solar or gridbased and migration of youngsters to distant places for work Amidst these while Adivasi communities retain material ties to their forests they no longer share perceptible utilitarian relationship with wildlife Some activists and commentators even label indigenous communities as natural conservationists born conservationists best conservationists and natural protectors of wildlife But are either the votaries or even critical voices cognizant of the ground realities Before the advent of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 which outlawed hunting and trade in wildlife derivates wildlife did have some benefits for Adivasis even if this utility could never match up to the varied material benefits of forests Back then access to broiler poultry or farmed goat meat was rare and wild game was a common meat source Wildlife products could be sold to earn money Many forest dwellers earned additional income by working as beaters or shikaris for citybased hunters However post1972 many Adivasis became either indifferent or even antipathic to wildlife The antipathy primarily stems from their perception of conservation legislations and programmes especially the creation of Protected Areas resulting in restricted community access to forests thus limiting their material relationship with the forests Their free movement through forest roads was hindered and basic health and education infrastructure development scuttled Wild animals caused loss to human life and property too Conservation interventions of the postindependence era which imposed new restrictions on land and forest rights are seen as a counterpart of imperial era forest reservation and game rules Many Adivasis perceive wildlife as a mascot for the states restriction over their forests and livelihoods As a forest guard in Jharkhand once told me Hum log jab haathi khadedne jaate hain toh inn log bolta hai apna haathi le jaao hamaara gaaonkhet se Jal Jangal Zameen inka aur Haathi ko kar diya van vibhag ka Whenever we go to chase off elephants that have entered villages villagers ask us to take away our elephants from their village and fields They claim ownership over Jal Jangal Zameen but label the elephant as Forest Departments property This deep antipathy towards forest and civil agencies in eastcentral India has historical roots in uprisings often over identity land and forest rights both during the colonial era and postindependence This partly explains why Maoists struck roots here while failing to gain a foothold in other forested landscapes Apart from their cultural and spiritual importance forests are central to the Adivasis economies Forests provide them with grazing grounds for cattle water for fields livelihood via nonwood produce like Tendu and Mahua firewood additional food security and traditional medicine Photo Siddique Salim Khan Another important aspect of this discussion is the culture of hunting as the traditional way of life of the Adivasi Hunting of wild animals occurs at two levels communalritual hunts and yearround hunting for bush meat Ritual communal hunting usually commences during the spring period or sometimes as a celebration of the postharvest season During such hunts thousands of Adivasi men go en masse into the forests to hunt For instance in places like the Singhbhumwestern West Bengal landscape as many as a lakh 100000 or even more hunters will fan across the forests spread over seven forest divisions between the two states Such communal hunts are an integral part of the social life of many forest communities The Santhals practice Disu SendraDisom Sendra Sendra means to hunthunting across all major Adivasi languages spoken in Jharkhand whereas Mundas and Oraons celebrate PhaguSendra Bishu Shikar the masshunt that happens around Dalma hills Jharkhand and the adjoining forests of western West Bengal is often in the news The Akhand Shikar of Similipal hills in Odishas Mayurbhanj district is also well known In Bastar and Gadhchiroli hunting festivals such as KedhKedhkul and Paradh are celebrated respectively by the Durwas and the Murias Marias Bhatras Parjas and others Similarly the Konda Doras as well as the Khonds also called Jatapu or Samanthas of the Vizianagaram hill tracts of Andhra Pradesh celebrate a common ritual hunting festival called Itika Pongal Other major indigenous groups of eastcentral India such as Birhors Bondos Gadabas Juangs Bhuiyans also have their own hunting festivals The number of such communal hunts in a year and the duration of each hunt vary widely For example multiple kedhs and paradhs are observed annually in Bastar The principal kedh of the Durwas is the Kil Medul Kedh while the primary paradh is the Badi Paradh or WijaWetta is organised from March to May While earlier such ritual hunts had rules that governed them they were diluted over time Now such mass hunts are almost always a killall hunt ie indiscriminate killing of wild animals without any restriction on the numbers of kills or what is being hunted a bird or a mammal a common species or an endangered one a male or a female a young one or an adultold animal Such indiscriminate hunting has especially plagued the Bastar landscape In one instance in Sukma zamindary a herd of 19 bison gaur were beaten into nets and the whole lot slaughtered wrote E Rooke in 1908 6 This deep antipathy towards forest and civil agencies in eastcentral India has historical roots in uprisings often over identity land and forest rights both during the colonial era and postindependence As far back as 195758 the disastrous impact of ritual hunts was being documented DG Sharma a forest officer wrote in 1957 of the Wija Wetta hunt Many villages combine together and do thorough beating of the forests by haka or setting fire to the forests and putting nets and snares of all sizes across the path of the animals many wild animals are captured and killed No rules regarding the number sex legal status of forests and methods employed in hunting are observed Bows and arrows spears axes and muzzle loading guns granted under crop protection licenses are the common weapons used All type of wild game is killed and nothing is spared Even tiger bison wild buffalo panther and bear are hunted Many a time tigers escape with wounds and become maneaters causing havoc subsequently in the interior The number of the animals killed in the parads by these adept hunters runs into hundreds 7 Noted biologist George Schaller who conducted fieldwork in Bastar in the mid1960s wrote In the West Bastar District the communal hunts by the tribal peoples indiscriminately destroy the wildlife over large areas so completely that even monkeys are rarely seen 8 Another major dilution has been the participation of anyone and everyone in such hunts irrespective of whether they are members of the same Adivasi community or not locals or outsiders Even nonAdivasis and nonforest dwellers including urban residents from nearby towns and faroff cities sometimes travelling from as far as 500700 km are allowed to be a part of many of these hunts especially in various Sendra hunts and Akhand Shikar In contemporary times a prime example of such killall freeforall mass hunt is the annual Sendra that happens in the forest landscape straddling Dalma hills and across the border into Purulia Jhargram Bankura West Medinipur and East Medinipur districts of West Bengal The shorter duration two to three days hunt in Dalma hills and adjoining forests of East Singhbhum and SeraikelaKharsawan usually record an influx of anywhere between 40000 to 50000 hunters The longer hunt in West Bengal that can span as many as 45 days attracts anywhere between 5000060000 hunters annually 9 The bag of one such Sendra here in 2018 consisted of everything ranging from a tiger the first recorded here in more than 100 years to eggs of forest birds wolves to foxes jungle cat kittens and their mothers to civet cats jackals to wild boars various deer species including fawns to common birds including chicks monitor lizards to turtles Anything edible is killed Similar hunts occur across various regions of eastcentral India Despite being completely illegal under various wildlife and forest laws as well as the Forest Rights Act the Forest Department is completely incapable of stopping such hunts as it does not have the manpower or capacity to stop andor prosecute such a mass influx of hunters In other areas such as Bastar and southern Odisha the Forest Department is absent altogether after being routed by the Maoists A tiger killed during ritual hunting on April 13 2018 at the Pakhibandh hunting festival a killall freeforall mass hunt that

wildlife of the region Eventually the rate of reproduction of surviving wild animals is not enough to compensate for the rate of their depletion through hunting thus leading to an irreversible decline that culminates into local and regional extinctions Ecologist Kent H Redford coined the term Empty Forest 10 to describe such a situation where an otherwise excellent wildlife habitat or ecosystem is rendered devoid of large mammals as a result of human impact This describes thousands of square kilometres of prime wildlife habitat across the eastcentral Indian landscape Let alone tigers even the once common herbivores no longer exist in the mixed Sal forests of this region We examine the march of the tigers towards oblivion first The tiger population of undivided Bihar was 85 in 1972 out of which 7072 dwelled in what is now Jharkhand Their number in Jharkhand had plummeted to single digits by the start of the 21 st century Similarly the districts that form Chhattisgarh today recorded about 160 tigers in 1972 the bulk of them in Bastar Their numbers plummeted to 26 in 2006 and 19 by 2018 with none in Bastar Of the three tiger reserves of Chhattisgarh tigers have been functionally extinct in SitanadiUdanti tiger reserve for more than a decade and teetering on the edge of extinction in Achanakmar tiger reserve Bastars Indravati tiger reserve though wiped clean of tigers sometimes gets a few tigers migrating out of the neighboring tigerrich forests of ChandrapurBhandaraGondia districts Maharashtra but has not had a viable stable population of its own for more than 40 years Tigers have been extinct for more than 30 years from the massive Surguja landscape of northern Chhattisgarh where Maharaja Ramanuj Saran Singh Deo of Surguja killed most of the tigers from his infamous bag of 1150 tigers some claim 1710 The first tiger census in Odisha in 1966 recorded 326 tigers They whittled down to 142 by 1972 though still evenly distributed across the state By 2018 Odishas tiger population had withered away to 28 The states only partially viable tiger population survives in the Similipal Tiger Reserve the second major population in Satkosia is extinct Gadhchiroli in eastern Maharashtra recorded 6070 tigers in 1972 They disappeared by 1990 A similar story is repeated in the northern TelanganaAndhra Pradesh landscape Back in 1972 an overwhelming bulk of undivided Andhra Pradeshs tigers were recorded from the forests of Warangal Adilabad Khammam and Karimnagar now in Telangana which consisted of five large wildlife sanctuaries Kawal 89233 sq km Eturnagaram 80615 sq km Pakhal 860 sq km Kinnersani 63541 sq km and Pranahita 13693 sq km Another significant population inhabited the Vizag Agency Tract forests of northeastern Andhra Pradesh which included a large national park Papikonda 101286 sq km By the turn of the 21 st century tigers had been wiped off from across this landscape including all the aforementioned Protected Areas Kawal was notified as a tiger reserve in 2012 but even nearly a decade later it continues to be tigerless except for transient tigers from Maharashtra sometimes moving in and then usually disappearing without trace Eastern Uttar Pradesh and southern Bihar which had a healthy tiger population until the 1970s lost all their big cats by the early 1990s The shorter duration two to three days hunt in Dalma hills and adjoining forests of East Singhbhum and SeraikelaKharsawan usually record an influx of anywhere between 4000050000 hunters The longer hunt in West Bengal that can span as many as 45 days attracts anywhere between 5000060000 hunters annually While these observations may seem like the story of the disappearance of one species it is an indicator of a much larger collapse Unlike Sariska Rajasthan or Panna Madhya Pradesh tigers and other copredators in the region have died out less due to direct poaching and more due to collapse of the food chain Virtually all large and mediumsized ungulates such as gaur sambars and chital were the first to go Other losses included the critically endangered hardground barasingha the last populations of which outside Kanha in Bastar and Sunabeda forests western Odisha were eliminated between the 1950s to late 1970s due to bushmeat hunts by villagers 11 A few dozen wild buffaloes now survive in a small patch of forest around the border of Bastar and Gadhchiroli They once ranged over central and south Chhattisgarh and southern Odishanorthern Andhra Pradesh Gaurs had become extinct from virtually all strongholds in Bastar north Chhattisgarh and south Odisha much before the tigers Jharkhand lost all its Gaurs except a single small isolated population of 5060 animals in a 20 sq km forest patch of Palamau tiger reserve 20 years prior to the tiger Similarly once abundant in Jharkhands nearly 30 per cent forest cover the sambar deer the primary prey of tigers had been hunted to local extinction throughout the state 2030 years before the tigers demise Common elsewhere in India the chital is now exceedingly rare in Jharkhand Similar accounts emerge from many other forests of eastcentral India Once the preybase disappeared tigers and other big cats were driven towards cattle killing as their main source of sustenance This led to large economic losses for the forest dwellers as well as attacks on humans in some cases The forest department largely absent from the field due to either administrative apathy or insurgency could neither compensate for the losses nor enforce measures against hunting Consequently most of the big cats were killed off by poisoning cattle carcasses The Palamau Tiger Reserve is one of the first nine to be declared in India In a 2021 interview with Sanctuary the author reminisces of his childhood days spent in the forests of Palamau with his father SEH Kazmi Photo Aditya Chandra Panda It is worth mentioning here that bushmeat and ritual hunting in eastcentral India does not have a food security aspect to it anymore it is primarily either carried out as a tradition or even as mere recreation what the Durwas of Bastar term as chularana anthropologist Madhu Ramnath translates it as to wander wherein there is nothing specific in mind of the Durwa when he sets out into the forest for hunting though the casual wandering for hunt may turn into walitana a chase or kaatana a long wait for the quarry 12 This is so because in addition to the reasons elucidated earlier in the essay regarding elimination of dependence on wild meat virtually all the forests of eastcentral India continue to suffer from the emptyforest syndrome for some decades now Moreover in ritual hunts the number of hunters is too large compared to the meat obtained Finally the proportion of hunters out of the total Adivasi population of a village is relatively small while an overwhelming majority are cultivation dependent Thus not only can wild meat not realistically impact the annual protein intake of an individual even its access is restricted to a few Moreover bushmeat hunting can be associated with the illegal wildlife trade Cases of big cats or other animals prized in illegal trade getting ensnared in traps set for bushmeat and then being sold off to wildlife traders are recorded every year Pangolins have also emerged as a commonly trafficked animal in the illegal wildlife trade supplied by casual bushmeat hunters Furthermore the regular seizures of leopard skins bones and claws from western southern and central Odisha including a seizure of eight leopard skins in a single day from Kalahandi in July 2021 along with a number of similar seizures of leopard and tiger skins bones and claws from southChhattisgarh over the past couple of years suggests possible deliberate and targeted hunting for wildlife trade in these landscapes as well Aapko gussa nahin aata Hundaar aapka khassi dhar leta hai toh Dont you feel angry when wolves snatch away one of your goats I ask a goatherder on the banks of Burha river in Mahuadanr Wolf Sanctuary on the southern tip of Palamau tiger reserve No The wolf takes his share After all he too needs something to survive he replies Mahuadanr the first wolf sanctuary of India is the site of one of the first natural history studies of the Indian grey wolf undertaken by SP Shahi the ace naturalistphotographer and forest officer of undivided Bihar almost half a century ago 13 While Palamau has lost much wildlife since then wolves still persist in Mahuadanr They continue to exist almost entirely on the goodwill of the local villagers who are gracious enough to let the wolves take their share of a goat or a chicken every now and then despite getting no compensation from the forest department Such bright spots even if few offer clues on the way forward It is worth mentioning here that bushmeat and ritual hunting in eastcentral India does not have a food security aspect to it anymore it is primarily either carried out as a tradition or even as mere recreation NagarjunasagarSrisailam Tiger Reserve NSTR now bifurcated between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is the largest Tiger Reserve of India set in the heart of a massive block of nearly 10000 sq km of tiger country clothing the Nallamalla hills that straddle across the two states The 1972 census recorded around 20 tigers here The Nallamallas are also home to Chenchu Adivasis a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group PVTG More than 50000 of these huntergatherers live in the Nallamalla forests While tiger numbers here had doubled to 40 by the mid1980s the entire landscape was soon overrun by Maoist insurgency For nearly two decades late 1980s to mid2000s the Nallamallas became an impregnable fortress of the guerrillas of the Communist Party of India MarxistLeninist Peoples War or Peoples War Group PWG During these decades of strife no information on the state of wildlife emerged from this landscape and experts feared that the megafauna had been wiped out Eventually once the security forces prevailed over the Maoists around 2006 the Wildlife Institute of India carried out the first scientific study of wildlife here To the surprise of even the most optimistic of conservationists more than 60 tigers were found in the then unified NSTR The adjoining GundlaBrahmeswaram sanctuary also harboured around a dozen big cats The Nallamallas have since emerged as a bastion of tigers copredators and prey species in the entire eastcentral Indian landscape Even with no law enforcer in sight the Chenchus and other local elements had not overhunted and left the fauna intact According to Hames Ideological approaches to the problem of conservation in tribal society have suffered from a number of theoretical shortcomings because the conditions under which conservation should evolve have not been specified It is never made clear why conservation is practiced by one society but not another The cause of conservation is often seen as a groups ethos or ideology but the conditions that favour the development of such belief systems are never made specific 14 The case of varied conservation outcomes in different parts of India populated by disparate indigenous groups is a testimony to this assertion on the need to study the conditions of decline Even within the eastcentral Indian landscape there is a difference in the severity of wildlife decline In the northern half of the eastcentral Indian landscape ie eastern Uttar Pradesh southern Bihar northern and central Odisha northern and central Chhattisgarh it is the large and mediumsized ungulates and large predators tigers and leopards that have primarily been extirpated Other mammals like bears langurs civets wolves jackals foxes and civets as well as the birdlife have not suffered drastic declines However the situation in large parts of southernhalf of eastcentral Indian landscape especially Gadhchiroli Bastar south Odisha is much worse where not only the ungulates and big cats but almost every single medium and small mammalia except bears and even much of the birdlife has been wiped off Researchers and anthropologists working in the heart of Bastar have noted the utter silence of the forests because even the commonest of birds have been hunted out Despite two decades of political strife in the the Nalamalla Forests Andhra Pradesh and lack of enforcing forces between 1980s2000 tigers managed to survive The Chenchus the Adivasi community living here and other local elements had not overhunted and left the fauna intact Photo Anjani Kumar How can the empty forests of eastcentral India be revived Can we create the same sense of ownership of the Jaanwar among them as they have over their Jal Jangal Zameen One step in that direction could be to address the issue of utility of wildlife Ensuring that communities incur direct visible benefits out of any conservation effort in these landscapes could begin to change the current outlook of wildlife being of no utility to the forest communities This could be achieved by income augmentation through wildlife tourism led by communities as well as through developmental and infrastructural benefits that accrue for villages and communities out of the expansion of the tourism sector However as the above in itself might not be a sustainable solution broader partnerships are needed The primary thrust of all major contemporary Adivasi struggles have been against diversion of their lands for mines dams roads and infrastructure and monoculture plantations each of which is equally destructive for wildlife Led by Adivasi groups and social activists the Forest Rights Act FRA 2006 often viewed with scepticism by some conservationists as being antithetical to conservation has in fact proved to me to be the most potent legislative tool for countering such diversions of forests It has proven more effective than the Indian Forest Act Forest Conservation Act Environment Protection Act and Wildlife Protection Act all of which have been easily coopted by the state machinery Moreover active conservation intervention from mainstream conservation is limited to a small fraction of Indias Protected Areas PA Network which consists of 51 Tiger Reserves 104 National Parks 566 Wildlife Sanctuaries 97 Conservation Reserves and 214 Community Reserves Forests within and around many neglected and poorlyknown PAs have been denotified and diverted without much outcry from conservationists The FRA has been a vital tool for local resistance in such situations For instance local protests against Vedantas Baghmara mining project in the Sonakhan forest abutting Barnawapara wildlife sanctuary Chhattisgarh evoked community rights clauses Ensuring that communities incur direct visible benefits out of any conservation effort in these landscapes could begin to change the current outlook of wildlife being of no utility to the forest communities There has long been Adivasi protest against the Bodhghat hydroelectric project which plans nine dams on the Indravati river at Bodhghat Kutru Nugur Bhopalpatnam and Inchampalli which would drown hundreds of square kilometres of the Indravati tiger reserve Bastar The Polavaram Project on the Godavari is deeply controversial for displacement Few are aware that it would also drown large parts of wildliferich Papikonda National Park in Andhra Pradesh The situation in forests outside the PA network is even worse where requisite forest and wildlife clearances can be even more easily manipulated while garnering little to no attention In such areas too its the Adivasis and allied organisations that have stepped up to protect the forests The struggles against mining in the Niyamgiri forests abutting Karlapat and Kotgarh wildlife sanctuaries in Odisha or the Hasdeo forests in Chhattisgarh abutting Achanakmar tiger reserves eastern boundary both of which are critical to the continued connectivity between eastcentral Indian PAs and with the wildlife and tiger rich forests of Madhya Pradesh are well known Adivasis have even fallen to police bullets in their struggle to save forests from infrastructural destruction such as the killing of eight of them in police firing at a protest against the KoelKaro hydroelectric project West Singhbhum Jharkhand in 2001 This project would not only further fragment the already mining ravaged forests of Singhbhum but would also snap the southwestern connectivity of Palamau tiger reserve with Odishas Similipal tiger reserve and other forests of north Odisha All these above stories have one abiding feature conservation organisations are absent and Adivasis and allied organisations are at the forefront of the protest In the vast forest areas beyond the network of sanctuaries and parks it is local resistance that stands out Led by Adivasi groups and social activists the Forest Rights Act FRA 2006 often viewed with scepticism by some conservationists as being antithetical to conservation has in fact proved to me to be the most potent legislative tool for countering such diversions of forests The aforementioned struggles are of course not engendered by wildlife conservation concerns rather because Adivasis need forests and land to sustains their lives cultures and livelihoods Despite that these struggles indirectly protect the habitat of wildlife by keeping the forest cover intact Conversely wildlife conservation schemes can also help protect forests that are vital to Adivasi and marginal peasant lives The need of the hour is to forge alliances between these two parallel movements They can be allies even if at times they are in contention Lands that are rich in megafauna or emblematic smaller taxa are more difficult to denotify and divert than empty forests Similarly existing PAs and even the creation of new PAs can act as a strong bulwark that makes the diversion of lands and forests falling within their purview more difficult However for the latter conservationists and foresters must redress the factors that cause antipathy towards PAs in the first place ie issues of access and sustainable use of forests hindrances to free movement basic provisions of healthcare and education as well as prompt compensation of wildlifeinflicted damage The creation of new Conservation Reserves CR where communities are statutorily empowered with a much greater stake in management and decisionmaking of the notified CR could be especially beneficial However there is no escaping some hard truths for tribal rights groups and social scientists either Their belief that community forest conservation automatically leads to wildlife conservation is a demonstrably false assertion The empty forests of eastcentral India attest to how biomass production and tree cover may continue to remain intact but key faunal species may still be rendered extinct Wildlife has certain specific biological and ecological needs from the forests they dwell in and without understanding them and making adjustments to human use of the forests accordingly wildlife cannot thrive Among the adjustments that might be required voluntary relocations from sensitive areas to create inviolate habitats in accordance with the provisions for the same provided in FRA 2006 Section 2b read with Section 4 and WLPA 1972 may also be needed Similarly agricultural expansion and its legal recognition under the Forest Rights Act may be socially just and yet damage the lowland and valley habitat of large and medium ungulates In fact from Kolhan Jharkhand to Koraput Odisha and Porahat Jharkhand to Phulbani Odisha a major limiting factor in the forest cover of the region has been the spatial honeycombing of forests both at a macro and micro level over the past decades into a mosaic of forested hills and cultivatedpopulated valleys This has been one of the major contributing factors along with hunting towards the extinction of large and mediumsized ungulates who depended on these valley habitats for pasture and water Conversely all human presence may not be as damaging as hardedged conservation policies often tend to assume Satyamangalam tiger reserve Tamil Nadu or the Soliga Adivasi inhabited tiger forests of BR Hills of Karnataka are good examples At the end of the day India can only be home to as many tigers as agreeable to those hundreds of thousands of forest dwellers who harbour the tiger amidst them and share its habitat It is now up to us to create the right conditions that hopefully can make them agreeable to more baghauts rather than less Navigating all these complex issues means that each area will need to come up with its own unique blueprint for management of their respective landscapes and engagement between forest dwellers

Gopalakrishnan W e walked in single file across the scrubland Our target was a small bird that you might pass off as an unremarkable robin anywhere else or at any other time of the year in India But when the charismatic Rufoustailed Scrub Robin Cercotrichas galactotes puffed its wings cocked its long rufous tail and allowed us to approach incredibly close cellphone cameras were almost as useful as bazooka lenses A round of exultant highfives followed Kutchh located at the westernmost tip of Indias westernmost state Gujarat falls on the migratory route of several avian species flying from their breeding grounds in the tundra in central Asia and eastern Europe to their wintering grounds in east and south Africa The diversity of habitats of Kutchh the Greater and Lesser Rann of Kutchh and Banni Grasslands attract these passage migrants that travel over the Central Asian flyway and AsiaAfrica flyway Among them are eight species that draw hordes of birders European Roller Redbacked and Redtailed Shrike Spotted Flycatcher Rufoustailed Scrub Robin Greater Whitethroat Common Cuckoo and Bluecheeked Beeeater You could call them the eight passage deities of Kutchh you can get their blessings only for a short period between midAugust and midOctober when they make a pit stop on their annual migratory passage through Kutchh The author noted that the Spotted Flycatcher was the third most observed species during the Passage Migrant Count of 2022 Photo Saurabh Sawant To reach Kutchh you need to get to Bhuj by train or air and head west and northwest towards the Greater Rann and the Banni Grasslands in these months to seek their darshan holy glimpse Mandar Khadilkar of the tour company Nature India and our Kutchh specialist birding guides Vikramsinh Sodha and Karthik Patel were figuratively the priests who were to do the rituals Apart from the eight passage deities our group of eight was also looking forward to receiving blessings from other migrants and residents such as the Eurasian Nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus and the Marbled Teal Marmaronetta angustirostris The Banni grassland was formed from the sediments that were deposited by the Indus and other rivers over thousands of years Photo Saurabh Sawant A Birding Haven The long bright tail of the Redtailed Shrike Lanius phoenicuroides shone like a beacon distinctly different from the Redbacked Shrike of course you would also have to differentiate them from their resident Baybacked and Longtailed cousins It was no surprise that the primary findings of the Passage Migrant Count PMC 2022 the first attempt ever in India to count passage migrant birds revealed that among the transiting birds the population of European Rollers Coracias garrulus is the highest With their pale head and maroon back these birds were everywhere completely supplanting the Indian Roller The Bluecheeked Beeeater Merops superciliosus the second highest species counted in PMC 2022 is easily distinguished from the smaller green ones but the Greater Whitethroat Sylvia communis has to be carefully sorted out from the Lesser Whitethroat Sylvia curruca It helped that the only flycatcher in this habitat at that time of the year was the Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata the third mostobserved species during PMC 2022 The Rufoustailed Scrub Robin Cercotrichas galactotes along with seven other species pass through Kutcch for a short period between midAugust and midOctober while migrating to their wintering grounds in Africa Photo Saurabh Sawant After sunset we checked out the nightlife with the fond hope of paying obeisance to the last remaining passage deity on our list the Eurasian Nightjar Instead we got a lovely Sykes Nightjar a winter migrant to Northwest India that had arrived unusually early and the common Savannah Nightjar Just as we disappointedly put away our torches and cameras for the long drive home a movement on the telephone wire adjacent to the road revealed the distinctive Eurasian Nightjar with its white wing markings A second sighting of the same bird down the road was even more relaxed as it allowed us detailed photographs A sighting of the Indian Nightjar rounded off the nightjar clan Vikramsinh said it was the first time in 11 years of birding in this habitat that he had seen four nightjar species in one night The residents and early winter migrants were pleasing fillers between the main deities Can there be a prettier sight than a cavorting Painted Sandgrouse couple oblivious to the cars nearby The answer would be a resounding yes if youre looking at four endangered Whitenaped Tits in a single frame or a pair of Whitebellied Minivets with the males orange breast glistening in the sunlight Striolated and Greynecked Buntings not easy to find elsewhere keptus engaged constantly The streaked tail of the Whitetailed Iora formerly Marshalls Iora distinguished it from its common cousin Warblers are generally not easy to distinguish from each other but not the lovely Orphean Warbler with its black head contrasting with its pale throat A Eurasian Wryneck managed a nearly 180degree turn towards us once we spotted it through its nearperfect camouflage Bluecheeked Beeeaeters may not always show the blue on their cheek but their turquoiseandwhite supercilium can help identify them from the closely matched Bluetailed Beeeaters Photo Saurabh Sawant All is however not hunky dory in this part of the world as most of Kutchh is outside the formal Protected Area network Development in the form of agriculture irrigation and other anthropogenic disturbances to the habitat results in shrinking natural spaces for these wonderful avian species to take a pit stop on their migratory journey We felt truly blessed and thankful after our darshan So

Health Team Wildlife Conservation Trust Mumbai M ore than halfway through 2020 the world continues to find itself in the middle of a pandemic of an unprecedented magnitude Initially reported in Wuhan China as pneumonia of unknown cause COVID19 has metamorphosed into a global pandemic Thus far over 15 million people have been affected and over half a million deaths across 215 countries and territories have been reported The disease is caused by a newlyidentified coronavirus SARSCoV2 which some believe may have originated from animals such as bats and entered humans from secondary hosts such as pangolins Wet Markets Speculations about animal origins and spillover of the disease to humans at wet markets in Huanan China are probably the least novel aspects of COVID19 The majority of newly emerging or reemerging diseases have originated in animals Diseases like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERS Ebola H1N1 swine flu and HIV are among prime global examples The Kyasanur forest disease monkey fever in southwestern India is a terrifying example closer to home Multiple factors including climate change increased human encroachment destruction of wildlife habitats and the illegal wildlife trade have been responsible for the spillovers Yet the growing demand for wildlife as pets or food or for dubious medicinal purposes remains unabated It is this increased contact between humans and animals that has created favourable conditions for spillover of viral diseases Globally connected markets and faster modes of transport have made it easier for diseases to spread quickly over large distances Wet markets have been held responsible for a number of diseases such as H1N1 Avian bird flu SARS and COVID19 all linked to animal hosts Yet limited and wholly inadequate regulatory actions have been taken to mitigate risks from zoonoses Diseases like SARS and MERS triggered discussions about the interconnectedness between the health of humans animals and the environment but these never achieved the reach and threat persistence over a prolonged period as COVID19 The current pandemic may just tip the scales in favour of seriously addressing zoonotic diseases systematically and holistically as envisioned in the One Health concept If we fail future pandemics are inevitable A wildlife market in Myanmar Photo Dan Bennett What Is One Health The potential origin of COVID19 from wild species forms the basis of the One Health paradigm linking human health animal health predominantly livestock and the environment The concept is not new and has been well established in the fields of veterinary and human medicine by those working in disease surveillance and food security But it has remained a niche area overlooked by mainstream medical and conservation researchers COVID19 has catapulted One Health onto centre stage as virtually every aspect of our lives has been impacted by the pandemic It could be argued that the One Health approach is an essential component of modern wildlife conservation and environmental protection The Conservation Connection Much of the illegal wildlife trade fuels the Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM industry in the Far East A part of that journey involves trafficked wildlife species that end up in wet markets and the exotic animal trade These environments where animals are kept in squalid unsanitary conditions provide a perfect storm for viral spread Although there is little evidence for the effectiveness of TCM the World Health Organisation WHO actually included a chapter on it in the 11 th revision of the International Classification of Diseases ICD11 in May 2019 We dont know if this led to increased demand for wildlife products but it did add credibility to the practice of TCM Dubious products such as bear bile tiger bone wine and powdered rhino horn are used by TCM to cure a number of ailments including COVID19 While some of these products come from captivebred animals many are trafficked from the wild to meet the needs of captive breeding Others are sold illegally at high prices in wet markets It is here in these melting pots that viruses cross over from animal hosts to humans in viral spillovers Traditionally wildlife conservation has remained focused on the welfare of iconic species such as the tiger and rhino in Asia The One Health lens looks at the impact of conservation by tackling the illegal wildlife trade to protect human health and prevent future pandemics Wet markets where animals are kept in squalid unsanitary conditions provide a perfect storm for viral spread Photo Dan Bennett The HumanLivestock Wildlife Interface Anthropogenic change in land use such as unsustainable agriculture grazing construction of linear infrastructure logging mining hunting and gathering forest produce leads to deforestation The fragmentation of habitats increases the interface between humans livestock and wildlife Emerging infectious diseases in wildlife and livestock often go unnoticed until they pose a direct threat to human health COVID19 and Ebola outbreaks are classic examples of why early warning systems and interdisciplinary collaborations are imperative to achieve human health food security and wildlife conservation goals In Central India tiger reserve buffer zones are hotbeds of interactions between humans livestock and wildlife For example more than 40000 humans with approximately a lakh head of livestock live in around 160 villages spread across 1600 sq km of the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh which is home to more than 100 tigers and thousands of herbivores plus 40 or so elephants All these species compete for resources land pastures and perennial water which in turn creates many interfaces for potential disease transmission Infectious diseases have played an important role in population declines and the extinction of wild populations of endangered species across the planet They continue to threaten many more The Department of Animal Husbandry is responsible for the overall health of livestock and disease surveillance of the region However high livestock population remoteness of location poor health awareness and shortage of resources are major challenges Limitation in access to veterinary care in rural regions could impact the prompt identification of diseases such as foot and mouth FMD and canine distemper that are known to jump from livestock to wildlife A field assistant vaccinates cattle for foot and mouth disease in a village in the buffer zone of the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve Photo WCT Access to Healthcare The risk of transmission of COVID19 in rural areas has increased drastically owing to the reverse migration of people from urban areas to villages Not surprisingly the number of COVIDpositive cases reported from these areas has been increasing Of the estimated 710000 government hospital beds available only 260000 37 per cent beds are available in rural areas This amounts to around one bed per 3100 people in India Also one allopathic doctor is accessible to 26000 people in rural areas compared to the national average of one per 10000 people Our frontline forest staff and their families live within these rural communities in and around forests The forest staff play a vital role in management of the wildlife human environment interface and the prevention of poaching and trafficking of wildlife Their health needs to be prioritised especially during such disease outbreaks Current work by the authors looking at the location of public health facilities around six tiger reserves and two wildlife sanctuaries in Maharashtra revealed that rural communities including forest staff must travel an average of 65 km two hours by vehicle from the park gate to the district headquarters in case of a medical emergency such as a serious injury or illness Our data highlights the challenges faced by the forest staff in accessing healthcare Impact on Tourism And Poaching Tourism generates crucial revenue which is reinvested into protection activities During the COVID19 lockdown Protected Areas PAs have faced indefinite closure of tourism operations but protection activities have to continue more so because unemployment has raised human dependence on forests Consequently the threat from poaching and encroachment has increased considerably The recent easing of restrictions in some states has reopened parks for tourists However the advent of monsoon coupled with social distancing norms will continue to impact the influx of visitors and not all guides and drivers will find employment It will be challenging for the Forest Department to limit the adverse impact of the pandemic on the overall health of the ecosystem Forest staff at the Pench Tiger Reserve Madhya Pradesh undergo a preventive health check assessing their exposure to noncommunicable disease risks Conducted in December 2018 the health checks benefited 91 forest staff from the reserve Photo Sanjay ThakurWCT Environmental Impact Reports suggest a significant reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions during the lockdown attributable to reduced industrial transportation and human activities But these environmental benefits are likely to be shortlived Governments across the globe have started to reopen businesses to boost economies many pushing to weaken existing environmental regulations in an artless attempt to revitalise economies To sustain the positive environmental impacts of the lockdown in the long run now is when we must prioritise measures to mitigate environmental damage WCTs One Health Interventions Acknowledging the interconnectedness between human health animal health and the environment it is only logical to promote collaborative efforts between these sectors to achieve their respective goals Focusing on the conservation workforce WCT aims to build capacities in the health sector impacting the frontline forest staff For them we earlier introduced preventive healthchecks that identified significant exposure to risk factors of noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular diseases We have also assessed forest staff exposure to health emergencies and delivered bespoke training for their management in remote field settings to over 1300 frontline forest staff in 18 PAs across Central India We are currently in the process of mapping the public health facilities around PAs in Central India to assess forest staff access to healthcare and emergency preparedness for future pandemics This exercise will also benefit a wider population of people living in and around PAs by nudging policy changes for improved access to affordable healthcare services What is vitally important is to identify and study humanlivestock wildlife interfaces and interactions For now our objective is to create a sustainable early warning system to detect outbreaks that may affect conservation of wildlife Towards this end over two years WCT has conducted a detailed FMD prevalence study on livestock at the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in collaboration with the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department the Animal Husbandry department and local communities Additionally we are currently collecting data on the spatial movement of grazing livestock to forewarn stakeholders on the frequency and intensity of interactions of domestic animals with wildlife to address future epidemic outbreaks at the wildlifelivestock interface Forest staff participate in a simulated safe extrication of an accident victim during a trauma management training session at the Gir National Park Gujarat The training programme held in NovemberDecember 2019 benefited 90 frontline staff from the park Photo Pooja ShindeWCT One For All And All For One There is no dispute regarding the role of both terrestrial and marine ecosystems in maintaining climate stability just as there is no disputing the role of a healthy lifestyle in prolonging human life For several decades species conservation has focused on securing habitats without much emphasis on tackling externalities The unprecedented dip in vulture populations belonging to the genus Gyps from as many as 40 million strong to 30000 in less than a decade because of the usage of an analgesic drug administered in domestic livestock the rising respiratory health hazard in Indias capital New Delhi due to falling air quality largely brought about by burning of agriculture waste in neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh the sudden death of over 30 Asiatic lions one of the most endangered large carnivores on Earth presumably due to the transmission of canine distemper virus CDV from domestic dogs and now the psychologically and economically devastating impact of COVID19 which has clear linkages with the wet markets in China it is becoming exceedingly obvious that the health of an individual animalplant or a group of individuals of one species or an entire population of a species or populations of several species and the habitat where these species are found or the security of neighbouring habitats or the stability of climate and the socialenvironmental economic stability of humans are all interlinked in more ways than previously thought There is no option but to have a holistic approach in addressing issues pertaining to the overall health of the planet The One Health concept simply put is all about internalising externalities while trying to solve a humanrelated a wildliferelated or a habitatrelated problem The coming half a decade is extremely crucial in bringing about this paradigm shift if we are to even have an outside chance of addressing the micro while keeping an eagle eye on the macro issues The One Health concept is an opportunity to unite the world for a common agenda to safeguard the health of our planet without discriminating between species or borders join the

not just about activists and field biologists it is replete with niche players It is amazing to think of the varied professional backgrounds and specialisations of those working in wildlife conservation Broadly defined communities of experts such as scientists artists writers and activists are often talked about but it is the eclectic and extreme specialists who make up the very fabric of nature conservation that intrigue me While conservation undoubtedly relies on the bedrock of science it still requires myriad specialists both from science and nonscience backgrounds to achieve the common goal of environmental protection preserving and restoring ecosystems for the benefit of biodiversity and people And therein lies its beauty As a Conservation and Science WriterEditor with the Wildlife Conservation Trust WCT I have been fascinated by specialisations we see in nature be it a grassland specialist such as the Great Indian Bustard or a highly specialised partnership between a plant and a pollinator such as the plantfig wasp mutualism where both exclusively depend on each other for survival More such fascinating specialisations abound in nature and I realised that interestingly nature conservation mirrored nature I spoke with some intrepid women professionals in conservation to paint a picture of the length and breadth of the exciting diversity this field can accommodate I chose to feature these seven women some of whom are my colleagues at WCT who chose to work in specialised niches to excel in their careers while contributing to conservation I asked them a common question How does your line of work translate into working for nature conservation and what is it that motivates you Read on to know what they had to say I belong to the Bugun tribe of Arunachal Pradesh The cultural roots of my people are deeply entwined with that of the forest We have always worshipped the biodiversity around us but until recently never looked at our forest through the lens of nature conservation Shaleena Phinya Photo Courtesy Shaleena Phinya Shaleena Phinya Coordinator Forest Protection Squad Singchung Bugun Village Community Reserve Arunachal Pradesh and Wildlife Filmmaker I belong to the Bugun tribe of Arunachal Pradesh The cultural roots of my people are deeply entwined with that of the forest We have always worshipped the biodiversity around us but until recently never looked at our forest through the lens of nature conservation For me when the opportunity to work with conservationists such as Nandini Velho and the Green Hub Fellowship see page 88 arose it steered me towards protecting and documenting the rich biodiversity in the Singchung Village where I lived Today I am a part of the forest patrolling squad for the Singchung Bugun Village Community Reserve and take immense pride in the fact that our community reserve is a firstofitskind for Arunachal Pradesh where an indigenous community that I belong to has come together with the Forest Department to protect a forest As a forest ranger I work to protect our community forest and as a filmmaker I document the incredible biodiversity and rich cultures to create awareness and shed light on the issues that threaten our forests and our way of life I have been inspired to contribute towards environmental conservation since I can remember and view the law as a means to an end Mridula Vijairaghavan Photo Courtesy Mridula Vijairaghavan Mridula Vijairaghavan Environmental Lawyer WCT I view policy and the law as effective tools for environmental conservation Good law and policy are often at the heart of conservation success stories In fact I believe that effective policy is one of the reasons why India has managed to conserve so much of its wildlife and habitat despite sharing space with13 billion people As an environmental lawyer I strive to ensure better implementation of existing law and for strong proenvironment law and policy This directly impacts the state of our wilds and of peoples rights I have been inspired to contribute towards environmental conservation since I can remember and view the law as a means to an end Im motivated by our culture that has a strong focus on conservation and by the people I work with colleagues communities and most importantly frontline Forest Department staff Thats every conservation filmmakers goal to enable every person watching with the power and ability to take charge and make change Eshika Fyzee Photo Courtesy Eshika Fyzee Eshika Fyzee National Geographic Explorer and Wildlife Filmmaker As the realm of wildlife filmmaking becomes more and more impact driven my role as a wildlife filmmaker is to tell important stories talk about important issues and make sure impact doesnt stop at just messaging There have been numerous conservation films in the past which have instigated a massive shift in audience behaviour consequently leading to public pressure and policy change Thats every conservation filmmakers goal to enable every person watching with the power and ability to take charge and make change What stimulates me is the world of possibilities that wildlife media brings with it how quickly the field is evolving and how it stands as one of the most powerful and influential tools we have today to make a significant impact in the field of conservation It brings me joy when people come back to me with a twinkle in their eye sharing their transformed views towards nature and wildlife around them Akshaya Zachariah Photo Courtesy Akshaya Zachariah Akshaya Elizabeth Zachariah Independent Illustrator Graphic Designer As a city girl I watched the beautiful city of Bengaluru turn into a filter of dusty grey with ever shrinking local biodiversity I grew up with art and wildlife and listening to stories of people in the wild only bolstered my longing to work for conservation someday After quitting my ninetofive job in 2018 I wanted to use my art for meaningful causes and practice slow living I believe that if I have the means to raise awareness and bring communities together I will pursue that path I use my experiences from travels my art journals and lately birding to share illustrated stories and facts with those who follow my work From the Endangered Species series to the latest Birds of India desk calendar it brings me joy when people come back to me with a twinkle in their eye sharing their transformed views towards nature and wildlife around them What motivates me to work on protecting the fishing cat and its habitat is the realisation that our fate is tied to its fate If the species suffers it means in the very near future we are going to suffer Tiasa Adhya Photo Courtesy Tiasa Adhya Tiasa Adhya Cofounder The Fishing Cat Project Fishing Cat Conservation Alliance Member to IUCN Cat Specialist Group Researcher The University of Transdisciplinary Health Sciences and Technology The species that has given me a purpose in life and on which I work is the fishing cat a globally endangered wild cat species that thrives in wetlands It occurs in the major floodplains and deltas of South and Southeast Asian countries starting from the Indus in Pakistan all the way to the Mekong floodplains and delta region encompassing Cambodia and Vietnam It is also found in the island country of Sri Lanka and Java The fishing cat is a top predator in its ecosystem and a key indicator of wellfunctioning wetlands What do functional wetlands mean for us Everything food baskets purified water reservoirs and carbon sinks What motivates me to work on protecting the fishing cat and its habitat is the realisation that our fate is tied to its fate If the species suffers it means in the very near future we are going to suffer from drought floods food shortage and other intensifying impacts of climate change Since the fishing cat distribution range lies mostly outside Protected Areas we need to work on socioecologically sensitive conservation models My conservation journey so far has been to advocate for such approaches involving multiple stakeholders The link between wildlife crime and trafficking of arms drugs and humans and the proven effectiveness of evidencebased policing really motivates me in my work which is to help frontline forest staff improve their investigation of wildlife crime C Samyukta Photo Courtesy C Samyukta C Samyukta Forensics Expert WCT Wildlife crime has been identified as one of the major drivers for the decimation of wild species and their habitats Leading international organisations like United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime UNODC have also verified the link between the monies that are generated through wildlife crime and the topthree unorganised crimes that plague mankind the trafficking of arms drugs and humans This link between these crimes and the proven effectiveness of evidencebased policing really motivates me in my work which is to help frontline forest staff improve their investigation of wildlife crime increase their chances of bringing wildlife offenders to justice and conserve wildlife through better enforcement of law Transition to nature conservation was an outcome of the intention to apply good economics to development issues Pooja Dewoolkar Photo Courtesy Pooja Dewoolkar Pooja Dewoolkar Economist WCT I studied economics data science and analytics until my masters programme only to realise in my final year the yawning gaps that exist between conventional economic theories and the equilibria that present themselves in the real world It was then that I realised that being able to apply these subjects well requires inclusion of ecology and correct estimation of the value that natural resources hold for us Transition to nature conservation was thus an outcome of the intention to apply good economics to development issues To be able to apply my core subjects in a way that takes into consideration development strategies holistically that is being inclusive of oftenexcluded externalities that get stacked against nature in such plans is a driving force for me I see it largely as a selfish gain to study interesting problems and hopefully find solutions that might help protect what we as a species should be valuing the most join the conversation subscribe Mud On Boots Project Mud On Boots The Mud on Boots Project is a Sanctuary Nature

I f you put in a good days climb in one of Northeast Indias Protected Areas hiking up from the river bed till you get to a good vantage point you should be able to see the mountain ridges covered in broccolicanopied forests receding wave upon wave until they seem to depending on which way youre looking either merge with the horizon or come up against snowclad peaks A hornbill would know this landscape like the back of its foot right down to the seasonality of every fruiting tree down to every cavity in the emergents rising above the canopy Like the old hunters of lore for instance or like elephant matriarchs perhaps Except that hornbills are actually the force that holds this landscape together Gardeners of the Forest Amongst the largest fruiteating birds of the tropical forests of Asia hornbills are often referred to as Farmers of the Forest By swallowing whole fruits and then broadcasting the seeds as they soar above the canopy hornbills play a crucial role in maintaining the vibrant diversity of tropical forests Undispersed seeds that accumulate in large numbers under the parent trees face multiple threats from pathogens insects rodents and other seed predators Even if the seeds manage to escape predation and germinate under the parent tree they still have to compete with numerous siblings for resources and then theres the threat rom herbivores who are attracted to the clump of saplings crowded together Birds like the hornbills are perfectly adapted to help the seeds escape these dangers in a mutualistic interaction wherein both hornbills and plants benefit In return for the nutritious pulp that the seeds are embedded in the hornbills scatter the undamaged seeds far and wide ensuring healthy regeneration for the trees Farmers of the forest the fruitloving Rufousnecked Hornbills Aceros nipalensis are a keystone species that can disperse an estimated 12000 large seeds per square kilometre every single day Several largeseeded plants are dependent exclusively on hornbills for their dispersal Photo Sarbajit Ghosh But first the hornbills must be able to locate a fruiting tree These are patchily distributed in a tropical forest and the availability of fruits within these patches changes over time Our research has found that different hornbill species that cooccur all predominantly fruiteaters often use different strategies to track the various fruits that they prefer over space and time As part of our research we put GPS tags on Great and Wreathed Hornbills in the Pakke Tiger Reserve Arunachal Pradesh in Northeast India We tagged a Wreathed and a Great Hornbill within days of each other Their nests were separated by only a few hundred metres and they had access to similar fruit resources Yet the Wreathed Hornbill ranged over an area of 55 sq km while the Great Hornbill ranged over only two square kilometres This is probably a consequence of the dietary choices of the two species while the Great Hornbill prefers figs the Wreathed Hornbill prefers nonfig fruits The ranging patterns also translate into differences in how far the two birds disperse seeds from the parent plant On average while the Great Hornbill dispersed seeds about 250 m away from the parent trees the Wreathed Hornbill cast seeds more than a kilometre away from the parent trees Both birds also regularly visited the degraded Reserved Forests outside Pakke Tiger Reserve thereby indicating how hornbills could aid natural regeneration of such forests We have estimated that in areas with very high densities of hornbills they could be dispersing up to 12000 seeds per day per square kilometre Since small fruiteating birds cannot swallow large seeds several of these largeseeded plants are dependent exclusively on hornbills for their dispersal The numbers of small seeds that hornbills disperse would of course be several orders higher A painted depiction of the Great Hornbill Buceros bicornis also banner image above showing the impressive wingspan about 152 cm of the largest hornbill species of the Indian subcontinent They can be found in the oldgrowth unlogged forests of the Western Ghats and in the forests along the Himalaya which are now increasingly fragmented Photo Sartaj Ghuman Spread Them Far and Wide In this day and age with forests facing unprecedented levels of fragmentation and the unmitigated wrath of climate change longdistance dispersal can be a boon It can ensure genetic connectivity between fragmented tree populations and also enable plants to move to suitable habitats with the changing climate Hornbills can perform the critical function of longdistance seed dispersal which not many other animals can In Northeast India for instance Wreathed Hornbills breed in the lowland forests from March to July During the winter low fruit availability in the lowland forests forces them to venture out in search of food Incidentally it is also the time when fruit availability in the midelevation forests peaks and so Wreathed Hornbills migrate up to the midelevation forests 400 2000 m of Namdapha Tiger Reserve in large numbers While other birds move to lower elevations in winter Wreathed Hornbills move up in search of some favoured fruits such as Canarium and Phoebe Great and Rufousnecked Hornbills on the other hand track their preferred fruits locally and do not migrate seasonally in and out of Namdapha Not only does this make the different hornbills important seed dispersers for different fruiting trees it also likely reduces interspecific competition permitting them to share the same habitat without conflict Ranging over large distances in search of patchily distributed fruit resources can have evolutionary implications for the birds as well Most of their close relatives like the Wreathed Hornbill travel over great distances the most famous being the Plainpouched Hornbills thatmigrate in large numbers from Thailand to Malaysia each year Another relative of the Wreathed Hornbills is the Narcondam Hornbill restricted to the 68 sq km Narcondam Island in the Andaman Sea Its global population is approximately 1000 birds One can imagine a flock of the Narcondam Hornbill ancestors to have taken off from mainland Myanmar in search of fruits and having landed on the island We do not yet know whether there were multiple waves of ancestors or a single flock that arrived on Narcondam to evolve into a different species To add to the perplexity the closest extant relative of the Narcondam Hornbill today is the Papuan Hornbill found in distant Papua New Guinea and its adjoining islands at the edge of the Pacific Ocean These hornbills historically ranged over large parts of the archipelagos of Southeast Asia that were geologically in flux and have thus left us with numerous such ecological and evolutionary puzzles that we are yet to solve A painting of the endemic Narcondam Hornbill Rhyticeros narcondami restricted to the 68 sq km Narcondam Island in the Andamans Photo Sartaj Ghuman Humans vs Hornbills What we are almost certain of however is that hornbills evolved in the midEocene around 50 million years ago in the African savanna the very place where 47 million years later early hominids evolved Our paths seem to have not crossed for a while but that encounter when it came was an unfortunate one for hornbills Hornbill remains found in caves in Vietnam and Borneo dating back to 24000 years are a testimony to their persecution at human hands Given the way humans now treat the planet hornbill persistence is even more precarious Their habitats are being lost at an alarming rate and they are going locally extinct from multiple sites Extensive Protected Areas like the Namdapha Tiger Reserve spread over an area of 1985 sq km which attract large numbers of Wreathed Hornbills are few and even they cannot guarantee the persistence of this farranging species These magnificent birds leave Namdapha to breed in the adjoining nonProtected Areas of India and in Myanmar where they are vulnerable to hunting and other anthropogenic threats As humans plough on in the pursuit of the ambiguous utopia of a developed world we will continue to trample these evolutionary enigmas under our everexpanding footprints What were also wrecking in the process is the quality of human existence It is therefore essential that we find alternative models of development that explicitly look upon nature conservation as an integral and elemental measure of human development For not only do these marvels of the natural world make life worth living they are what make life possible Slow breeders hornbills are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures Hunting by indigenous communities who use the beaks and casques for traditional charms and headgear also poses a threat However some NGOs have successfully encouraged the use of fibreglass replicas to stem hunting and have initiated programmes to benefit communities

to access our issues for free ok Photo Romulus Whitaker Previous Next Irulas The Snake Trackers First published in Sanctuary Asia Vol 23 No 8 August 2003 By Janaki Lenin F or the last 10 years I had been watching the legendary Irulas the snake catching tribe of south India from the periphery Finally in 2002 I got my chance to spend a week with them and what a week it was Rom Whitaker was curious as to what effect the Irula snake catching cooperative had on wild snakes and so we had come to the Chengalpattu district where snakehunting for venom extraction was the most intensive The fact that the snakes were released after the venom was extracted unlike other antivenom extraction setups also made Chengalpattu the right place to ascertain the effect if any of snake trapping on wild snake populations Roms life has long been inextricably tied with the Irulas a tribe he met in the 1970s on one of his snake trips to the south He was then based outside Mumbai and was extracting venom for the Haffkine Institute He travelled regularly to Bengal for banded kraits and monocellate cobras to Ratnagiri for sawscaled vipers and to Chennai for kraits and Russells vipers Harry Miller a wellknown local journalist put him in touch with the Irulas Rom was amazed by their skill at snake catching they could literally track down snakes He felt much more at home in south India having schooled in Kodaikanal and suddenly for the first time Rom had a peer group of snake hunters in India He soon moved to the outskirts of Chennai near an Irula settlement and started Indias first snake park His first business mates were the Irulas their easy sense of humour and Roms frugal lifestyle complemented each other Around the same time Rom was discovering that the snakeskin industry was hammering snake populations all over the country At the industrys peak in 1966 25000 snake skins were processed countrywide every day In an average year it was still about 17000 skins per day So every year for probably 50 years six million snakes were being killed for watch straps belts shoes and handbags And this is a conservative estimate The snakes being killed included cobras rat snakes Russells vipers and pythons When the large snakes became harder to find the industry settled for water snakes The Irulas were the largest suppliers of skins With their incredible tracking skills the snakes just didnt stand a chance Rom and other conservationists lobbied hard to have the snakeskin industry shut down and eventually the government listened declaring the industry illegal in 1975 Before the snakeskin trade was banned millions of cobras were killed each year Photo Romulus Whitaker Overnight thousands of Irulas were without a livelihood Although Rom felt sorry for them he never regretted the ban on snakeskins While drinking toddy and chatting with the Irulas in the evenings Rom grew confident that they could do what he had been doing extract venom from snakes and sell it to the antivenom manufacturers The idea was to form a tribal cooperative but this was easier said than done There were so many legal and bureaucratic gauntlets to run that soon the focus was in danger of being lost Snakes were now protected by the Forest Department while venom was construed as a chemical regulated by the Department of Industries Neither wanted the cooperative under their jurisdiction It was an anomaly the only cooperative utilising wildlife Finally it was thanks to the gumption of one lady that the cooperative became a reality at all Revati Mukherjee After months of waiting in the corridors of the State Secretariat Rom was getting despondent Revati a good friend and no respecter of obstructive bureaucracy went straight to the top browbeating the secretaries in charge until they buckled probably just so they could be rid of her And thus the cooperative came into being It took another four years for the reluctant Forest Department to issue licenses to the cooperatives members Finally in 1982 the Irulas had license to catch the big four venomous snakes cobras kraits Russells vipers and sawscaled vipers The cooperative bought the snakes and extracted venom to sell At the end of the year the profits were tallied up and distributed among the 60 members Venom was extracted thrice in three weeks from each snake Then in a unique break from the procedure followed by every other venom facility in the world the snakes were returned to the wild In the last two decades the Irulas have caught close to 100000 snakes All the snakes have their belly scales clipped in code year and month of capture and date of release so that they arent caught again any time soon It is important that this does not happen because the snakes need time to feed and recover The scales eventually grow back obliterating the code but by then the snake has recuperated In any event the chances of catching the same snakes are very slim The Irulas hunt along paddy fields catching rats mice and snakes The farmers are happy to get rid of the pesky rodents as well as the dangerous predators After the venom is extracted the snakes are released in forests the Irulas would probably be lynched if they released the venomous snakes back in the fields where they were originally caught This Russells viper banner image at the Irula cooperative will be milked of its venom once a week for three weeks before being released in an uninhabited area After the ban Rom Whitaker worked with the Irulas above to establish a snake catchers cooperative to extract venom for the antivenom industry Photo by Janaki Lenin So 20 years after the cooperative became operational Rom decided to have a casual look at the snake populations in the district of Chengalpattu For a week we went trudging along rice field bunds looking for snakes It was July the heat was searing The northeast monsoon was a few months away and the land was parched We picked up Kali the son of a legendary Irula snake hunter and healer Chockalingam Kali had married when he was 18 and already had two children at 22 His hamlet consisted of about 20 huts on the outskirts of the Manamadi village about 30 km south of Chennai They had no electricity just a lone streetlight that lit the whole village at night Water was brought from a kilometre away by the women Hardly any of the kids went to school Their hair was coppercoloured from malnutrition All of them were sparsely built from a life of hardwork and poor nutrition These are among Indias poorest people Most adults work as casual labourers in farms and rice mills The cooperative could only handle 300 members from a 25000 strong tribe Kali has been hunting snakes since he was 10 years old At 14 a sawscaled viper bit him on his forefinger While he was not in any danger the pain searing through his finger was so intense and unbearable that he thrust his finger into the fire Hes too embarrassed to talk about the incident so we dont know whether there was any relief from the pain Now he has a slightly deformed finger Thats one thing Ive noticed about most snake hunters shaking hands with them is like shaking a crabs claw When I comment on it Rom reminds me of his adage Snake hunters never die They just rot away Joking apart most snake hunters live dangerous lives Theres no such thing as too much concentration or caution when dealing with venomous snakes There can be no distraction no hesitation no mistakes And as you hunt you go deeper and deeper into the countryside and further away from the main road transport and any possible help The remoteness of the location is one thing but Roms various allergies to antivenom serum to cobra venom to krait venom are complications that we could live without Thus the constant refrain about concentration Ammu and other Irula children start off handling nonvenomous snakes such as this red sand boa but they soon graduate to venomous ones By the time they reach adulthood snake catching is made to look easy Photo by Janaki Lenin Rice farmers dont like too many trees It was a vast flatland of rice fields with small stands of trees the only shade in the whole landscape It is to these copses that we headed looking for tracks and rat burrows along the dykes When Kali did not pause over several burrows I asked him why He nonchalantly replied Theres nothing in there Its an old hole He was looking for fresh tracks fresh diggings scat outside the holes and where there were none he didnt pause for a second glance To my untrained eyes I couldnt tell where to look for tracks on a baked earth with dry stalks of grass sticking out all over the place It was getting hotter and hotter and it was only 10 am I could have sworn it was 2 pm I was exhausted We had been walking for four hours We walked along a cotton field Kali found a burrow with snake tracks It looked like any other hole to me and I did have my glasses on And then to add insult to injury he proclaims that the tracks go in but dont come out Now how on earth could a slight smoothness on the earth say so much But Kali was certain and he began digging Rom found another hole which was part of the same burrow system while Raju Kalis snake hunting partner scouted around to see if there were any escape routes I wanted to find the next rat burrow with a snake in it but the heat was making me listless So halfheartedly I walked along an adjoining dyke looking for burrows and tracks while the boys were busy digging One of them yelled and I raced back Kali was just handing Rom a young cobra by the tail and he continued digging He thought there was a second cobra in the same hole And no prizes for guessing if he was right These Irulas have just tracked down and caught an adult cobra Photo Romulus Whitaker In a ditch overgrown with ipomoea Kali found a whole clutch of baby Russells vipers They were perfect miniatures of the adults I cannot tell what science caused Kali to believe that tramping around in the ipomoea would lead him to baby vipers I suppose a combination of skill and several years of hunting knowledge would tell him that this is the season when Russells vipers drop their babies and when he sees the right habitat he checks it out So where I just see a ditch overgrown with ipomoea Kali sees the ideal hangout for baby vipers Where I just see a rat hole Kali sees a cool place where a cobra would want to lie low to beat the heat Walking back to the car in the evening Kali stopped at a palmyra tree and poked around with a stick A minute later he pulled out a sawscaled viper Now how did he do that He couldnt tell me what made him check that particular palm tree and not its neighbour This was crazy either he was having us on he could have come over the previous day and secreted a sawscaled viper in the tree or it was some kind of magic Thinking about it now maybe Kali caught a movement out of the corner of his eye and investigated I suppose the trick is also to get under the skin of the snake to figure out where it could be Rom says snake hunting is actually a systematic search of all possible snake hiding places literally and figuratively leaving no stone unturned But even that requires a greater skill than one realises Theres no way I was ever going to learn anything about tracking Give me sand dunes with big game any day where animal tracks are written as large as bold print At the end of our sevenday hunt we totalled 55 snakes of 10 different species Rom made it a point to collect shed skins as indicators of relative snake abundance even ones we didnt see and the tally was 158 shed skins For a preliminary survey conducted during the worst time of the year for snakes it was obvious that the four species of snakes were doing very well indeed and capturerelease methods being followed by the Irulas were having no negative effects on the snake populations But what wed really like to do is radiotrack some of the snakes that the Irula cooperative releases and insert tags in others so we have an idea of where these released snakes go and what they do If there is any snake freak out there whos looking for a project heres one that desperately needs doing The Irula cooperative by extracting venom and releasing the snakes unharmed has provided members of the community with a livelihood without affecting wild snake populations Photo by Romulus Whitaker Indias Big Four Cobras kraits sawscaled vipers and Russells vipers love farmlands where juicy rodents are abundant and accommodation comes free with the food Cobras live in the ricefield dykes inside rat burrows venturing out only to find their next meal It is the commonest venomous snake in India Kraits love piles of bricks well tailings firewood anything that is piled up They feed on rats and other snakes and are the most toxic land snakes in Asia Sawscaled vipers are more mysterious These little snakes emerge as though from nowhere after the rains and then completely disappear during the dry season These cause the most number of venomous snakebites in the world Russells vipers tend to hang out in bushy thorny thickets agave fence borders are ideal They are emerging as the primary snake species

in Nameri Tiger Reserve watching a flock of Amur Falcons milling over sandbanks along the Bharelli river Their movements seem like a set of changing alphabets against the clear blue Assam sky The birds we presume are migrating from China through India to their wintering grounds in South Africa and every year they continue to do so in flocks of thousands But unlike the usual manner in which the arrival of these migrant birds are heralded by the media this year they are being seen as vicious outsiders carrying with them the phantom of death In the past month or so the world has suddenly been whipped into a fearfrenzy over the bird flu epidemic that could take on gargantuan proportions and it has become almost mandatory to compare it to the 1918 pandemic that is said to have killed 18 million people worldwide This fear has spread from ostrich farmers in South Africa to observers of wildfowl in British Columbia and in India major centres for migrant birds such as Kaziranga and Bharatpur that were once seen as great oases for birdlife have overnight become red alert zones where people may contract the virus from the visiting birds But then how serious is this notyetoccurred epidemic that we apparently need to be waging a war against The most noticeable largescale announcement on combating the war on flu came from none other than George W Bush the President of the United States At this moment there is no pandemic influenza in the United States or the world But if history is our guide there is reason to be concerned In the last century our country and the world have been hit by three influenza The first which struck in 1918 killed over halfamillion Americans and more than 20 million people across the globe Likewise the British Government has publicly announced that more than 50000 people are likely to die in Britain but has privately told the media that it is preparing for up to 750000 deaths Irresponsible statements from healthcare professionals have further fuelled the crisis and experts from the UK are saying that the British death toll could even reach two million The current mediachurning of breaking news continues unabated while vital voices that do not fuel the fear are ignored In the October 29 th editorial of the British Medical Journal a senior scientist wrote avian influenza viruses do not usually infect humans and hence there was grave concern when 18 human cases of influenza caused by birdtohuman transmission of AH5N1 avian influenza occurred in Hong Kong in May 1997 with six deaths Given the large number of infected chickens then in the Hong Kong markets birdtohuman clinical infection was clearly rare Public concern waned when culling of more than 15 million chickens halted the epidemic It is hard to believe that science is being abandoned for how do they make the giant leap of faith that 60 deaths will translate to two million But then not that hard when we realise that such statements succeed in converting society into a huge market of fearfilled antibird flu drug consumers It may be interesting for readers to know President Bush went on to stress that at this point we do not have evidence that a pandemic is imminent Even if the virus does eventually appear on our shores in birds that does not mean people in our country will be infected Avian flu is still primarily an animal disease And as of now unless people come into direct sustained contact with infected birds it is unlikely they will come down with avian flu But then what made the President call on the Congress to immediately pass a new US 71 billion in emergency funding to prepare for that notsoimminent danger That is when things start becoming suspicious On October 28 2005 the Senate passed an eight billion dollars emergency funding bill to address the growing avian flu panic The World Bank has already proposed one billion dollars for the war against bird flu of course it spends much more than that to destroy the worlds wetlands upon which migratory fowl are largely dependant The only medicine we are told which reduces the symptoms of avian flu is a branded drug called Tamiflu that features prominently among President Bushs list of emergency measures A purchase of 20 million doses of Tamiflu has already been made and the US Congress is to appropriate another one billion dollars for this drug What good news for the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche which holds the sole license to manufacture Tamiflu The drug was actually developed and patented in 1996 by a Californiabased biotech firm Gilead Sciences Inc It prefers to maintain a low profile in the current rush to Tamiflu but this might be because of who is tied to Gilead In 1997 before he became Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld was named Chairman research of the Board of Gilead Sciences where he remained until early 2001 when he became Defense Secretary According to Fortune October 31 Rumsfeld holds a Gilead stake valued at between five and 25 million dollars and the global rush to buy Tamiflu has amounted to a windfall of at least one million dollars for Rumsfeld The Gilead board also includes Bechtel Corp Director George Schultz I dont know of any biotech company thats so politically wellconnected says analyst Andrew McDonald of Think Equity Partners in San Francisco Gilead now wants to regain control of the drug from Roche and accuses it of not doing an adequate job in manufacturing and marketing while the latter denies this saying Tamiflu is hard to make and it would take another company three years to get up to speed in producing the drug But what it is actually saying is that it does not want to share its profits with anyone else Cipla the Indian pharmaceutical firm says it can start producing this drug by January and India on its part is taking initiatives that aim at the production of cheaper alternatives to Tamiflu The World Bank always an advocate on policies for developing countries has decided not to be part of the mission that is talking about licenses for the patent Is this silence merely incidental Another danger that is emerging is that the current war on flu as it is being portrayed is dissolving all borders between the military and social institutions The Bush administration claims to be referring to this as a catastrophe in which the Pentagon would be the only agency with enough strength to respond Behind all this lurks the fact that officials are rewriting the plan to designate not just who cares for the sick but who will keep the country running amid the chaos said an influenza specialist who is advising the British government on those decisions Amongst the measures being taken in developing countries that could be potentially affected by bird flu is the culling of chickens Close domestic proximity of fowl pigs and people facilitates the transmission of the virus from animal or bird to man a situation common in rural Asia Recently Margaret Say Southeast Asian director for the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council told Reuters that while some governments were working hard to fight the virus others were becoming a bit slack We cannot control migratory birds but we can surely work hard to close down as many backyard farms as possible Why is the US Poultry and Egg Export Council so keen on closing down farms It may interest readers to know that Laurence Tiley of Cambridge University and Helen Sang of the Roslin Institute in Scotland are involved in developing transgenic chickens that would involve genetic material inserted into eggs to allegedly make the chickens H5N1resistant This would mean opening up of new markets for GMOs The dangers of genetic monopoly of foodproducts are known to everyone and it will be the poor rural farmers and the developing Asian countries that will lose out As far as the flu goes were still waiting for Godot What Flu Over The Cuckoos Nest Avian influenza is a contagious disease affecting birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus Although 15 subtypes of the virus are known the pathogenic outbreaks to date have been caused by subtypes H5 and H7 Avian influenza could manifest itself as a mild illness or a fatal and contagious epidemic Migratory waterfowl are the most common carriers of the flu while domestic poultry are the most susceptible to it It is difficult to develop vaccines against it because the virus is constantly shifting and drifting and a mild strain can mutate into a fatal one Drifting is when the imperfect replication of the virus alters its antigenic composition Shifting is when two differing subtypes exchange or rearrange genes and merge to become a completely different virus If one of these has genes from a human strain of the influenza virus the infection could rapidly affect humans as well Shifting requires a mixing vessel where both human and avian strains are present and can be reassembled Pigs were considered to be the vessels but recent research has shown that for some strains humans themselves might be the mixing vessels This is what triggered fears of an influenza pandemic The subtype H5N1 is of particular concern because it mutates rapidly and has a tendency to pick up genes from animal influenza strains join the conversation subscribe Cocoon Conservancy Project Cocoon Conservancy Community Owned Community Operated Nature COCOON Conservancies are

set down his backpack of cane and bamboo at the base of the tree Barefoot he clasped the trunk with his arms and legs and climbed up to about nine metres high Swiftly he slid across a thick horizontal branch and extracted a dead redbellied squirrel out of the handmade trap he had set two days earlier Cameras in hand Shilpi and I stood below on the rainforest floor with Jarjo and Maga the other Nyishi hunters who were guiding us through the community forest surrounding their village Dense forests crowded around us and it was impossible to see further than a few metres ahead For us travelling with camera equipment and camping gear it was an experience unlike any other Tai slid down the tree and was on the ground in less than 30 seconds Maga picked up the squirrel and turned it over then placed it in his pack As we continued along the same steep path that had taken us this far slipping and slithering across leaf litter our companions pointed out other traps on the way We crossed gushing streams on bridges made of single tree trunks On our way Jarjo mimicked the sounds of a barking deer fawn in distress in the hope of luring its mother and pointed out the tree gum that hunters used for trapping birds The Nyishi tribes like many of the other tribes of the Northeastern states have been hunting these forests for generations In addition to using traditional traps todays hunters catch wild animals using guns and metal traps The meat fur feathers and bones of animals are consumed sold used for decoration and for rituals during festivals Wild meat from forests such as those around Rachi Village has reached the marketplaces in bigger towns where it is sold at high prices When we first visited these markets we were deeply shocked by what we saw Hundreds of birds were bunched together in clusters hornbills barbets and many rare species They were being sold for Rs 500 to 800 per cluster Civets and squirrels were on sale for under Rs 1000 A barking deer was sold to a government officer for Rs 6000 While the meat is mostly traded for local consumption the gall bladders of Himalayan black bears is retained by hunters as these could be sold at a premium ranging from Rs 3000 to 15000 in different parts of the Northeast It can be assumed that the buyers were usually dealing with illegal wildlife trade on a larger scale The women selling the wild meat had straight answers they were earning about Rs 2500 a month from vegetables and fruits and about Rs 15000 from the sale of wild meat which meant instant cash for them The sheer abundance of wild meat in the markets was an indicator of what is found in the forests of the Northeast But that abundance was clearly on the decline Forest after forest is silent as bird populations decline On the forest floor deer civets and many other mammals are disappearing while Himalayan black bear cubs are becoming orphans The burgeoning illegal wildlife trade is silencing the forests of the Northeast Species such as the slow loris Nycticebus bengalensis banner are mostly sold for the pot The filmmakers documented how hundreds of animals from rare birds above to civets and barking deer were available on sale in local markets Photo Shilpi Sharma Going Going Gone We continued to film the three young men and walked until evening before settling down at a clearing Our Nyishi companions brewed black tea and we sat around a small fire As I gazed into the flames I recollected how our journey into the Northeast had begun In 2002 we filmed the very first rehabilitation of two orphan Himalayan black bear cubs in the Pakke National Park in Arunachal Pradesh The Arunachal Forest Department and the Wildlife Trust of India were working together to successfully rehabilitate the cubs that had been orphaned by hunting But sadly we knew that even with a successful relocation nothing stopped the bears from being hunted down again as adults Hunting is common in all the seven Northeast states of India Arunachal Pradesh Assam Nagaland Tripura Manipur Meghalaya and Mizoram Over the next five years we crisscrossed through the Northeast in shared jeeps buses and on foot Our goal was to document the extent of hunting and to determine whether there was any hope for the future of wildlife in the Northeast In the process we spent time with several tribes including the Apatanis Chakesang Nyishis and attended many of their festivals We witnessed the traditional uses of animal parts the langur head the claws of monkeys and cats the skin of bears and other animals and the beaks of hornbills On one occasion while filming in a village we came across a young boy who had just returned with a monkey kill He wanted to use the fur to make a new cover for his dau dagger case His reasons were simple he was attending a wedding and it was a matter of prestige In Chizami village Nagaland the interviews we did with different generations of hunters provided an interesting revelation on the decline in wildlife here The older hunters had intimate knowledge of the animals their habitat the food they eat even their smell They could identify the animals from the photographs very easily The younger hunters had much less information on the animals and the teenage boys had hardly seen any mammals Hunters like Maga Tai and Jarjo were now finding themselves wandering further and further afield to find the animals they were seeking Hope For The Future In January 2007 in Rachi Village they arrived at a consensus they decided to selfimpose a ban on hunting for three years In some other isolated pockets of the Northeast there are people from the community who are trying to reverse the trend In Khonoma Nagaland the youth took upon themselves to ban hunting as their forests were almost silent Incredibly they have managed to sustain the ban for 10 years to revive the wildlife population and set up infrastructure for ecotourism Many of the hunters we spoke to were willing to be wildlife guides if they were given a chance to make a livelihood In Manas Assam there is already a successful example where expoachers have turned into forest guides and are doing that at a much lesser income because they realise that it is more sustainable The making of The Wild Meat Trail has been an eyeopening experience Our film is just a glimpse into the many layers and complexities that shroud the wild meat trade in the Northeast Most powerful for us are the glimpses of hope in the film the examples of change though few are the first steps towards a more sustainable future The urgency of the situation however cannot be ignored Much much more needs to be done and it needs to be done now before we lose what remains of our wildlife the spirit of the people their connection with the forest and our opportunity to forge a new path for India that will set an example for the rest of the world The film The Wild Meat Trail by Dusty Foot Productions won the Panda Award in Wildscreen 2010 Also

to access our issues for free ok Photo DK Bhaskar Previous Next The Wildlife Supermarket First published in Sanctuary Asia Vol 26 No 4 April 2006 By BK Sharma There are strong indications that the illegal wildlife trade in India has financed terrorism insurrection and that there is a revolving door between international gangs dealing in arms drugs and wildlife contraband Protecting our wildlife and the forests in which wild species live must therefore be seen as an internal security issue for India not merely an animal welfare issue The author was presented with a special SanctuaryABN AMRO Wildlife Service Award 2005 for his work in fighting the wildlife trade Here he sketches an outline of the manner in which the bloody business thrives in the very heart of New Delhi the capital of India I n India the illegal wildlife trade has tended to concentrate in a few prominent centres for a variety of reasons Proximity to Protected Areas is of course a key factor as are rail and road communications that facilitate easier transportation of contraband often disguised as legitimate consignments with innocuous items The concentration of trafficking networks are often headed by traders who have historically dealt with wildlife articles on the basis of their caste and other such considerations Within such communities we have observed real competition as to who is able to conduct the largest trade and therefore access the widest market for transborder bulk buyers It helps of course that large cities provide anonymity while large settlements of ethnic populations not all of whom are involved in any illegalities facilitate clandestine operations It is a vicious circle the notorious reputation and dubious distinction that some towns have attract more buyers and this in turn encourages green horns to take up the lucrative profession by emulating those who exude wealth and power thereby further sustaining the deadly illegal trade Ironically over the years it is the national capital region of Delhi that has emerged as the most prominent centre for Indias illicit wildlife trade The earliest incontrovertible evidence of a gigantic market emerged in August 1993 when the Delhi Police with the assistance of forest department officials and TRAFFICIndia seized a huge haul of 283 kg of tiger bones estimably representing the remnants of 25 tigers Along with the bones eight tiger skins 43 leopard skins and over 100 skins of sundry protected animals were seized from Pema Thinley a Tibetan exile and Mohammad Yaqub a known local skin trader The sheer scale of the haul was staggering and the claim of the accused to the undercover operator that they could produce 1000 kg of tiger bone within a month revealed the mammoth scale of Delhis wildlife market Investigations further revealed the existence of a huge network of traders including Sansar Chand who were procuring wildlife articles from across the country storing and supplying those to buyers from Nepal and Tibet Sariskas tigers have been wiped out and other national parks and sanctuaries are under attack right now Rhino horn tiger skin elephant ivory are all exchangeable for cash This places the future of such cubs in jeopardy Photo NC Dhingra In the past 10 years Delhi has continued to be the centre of the illegal tiger trade In August 1994 12 mounted tiger heads and a tiger skin coat were seized from New Rohtak Road and in December 1994 two tiger skins were found with a relative of Sansar Chand The Special Branch of the Delhi Police then seized six tiger skins from a Kashmiri trader in April 1996 and in November 1997 a person was arrested in Delhis Nizammuddin area with a tiger skin By the end of 1998 two separate seizures in Delhi threw up two tiger skins a leopard and some chital deer skins There was a skin recovery in 1999 and in the year 2000 two separate confiscations in Lajpatnagar and Anand Vihar had the police on the tail of traders with international links In 2001 and 2002 we were able to record just one skin seizure each and in February 2003 the Delhi Police recovered a skin and a mounted tiger head Clearly the trade was alive and well but equally clear was the fact that we were way behind the trade which was thriving but which had managed to escape detection When seizure data over the years is analysed it suggests that Delhi trades in almost everything that the illegal wildlife market is willing to lift Ivory carvings bangles buttons and cane handles collectively weighing 264 kg were seized from two accused in April 2001 while in August 2005 a shop owner from Bhavnagar in Gujarat was arrested in North Delhi with six kilogrammes of raw ivory in his possession In July 2004 an 18 kg consignment of copperhead rat snake skins imported from Hong Kong was discovered and on October 15 2005 the Delhi Wildlife Department found an illegal consignment of 95 birds including six peacocks at the Anand Vihar bus terminal One of the largest seizures of birds took place at the international airport on May 13 2001 when 1200 Red Munias and 33 Alexandrine Parakeets were stopped before they were smuggled to the middle east The birds had been labelled as captivebred finches A nationwide coordinated search operation in several cities including Delhi and its adjoining areas in June 2002 saw the recovery of nearly 1000 kg of common mongoose hair used in the manufacture of painting brushes Heaven alone knows how many animals died to cater to this demand The seizure of leopard and otter skins especially from consignments destined to Nepal are almost too numerous to count The horn can easily be removed from a dead rhino as the forest guard in the photograph previous page was instructed to do when one of Kazirangas rhinos died a natural death The horn is so removed to prevent theft Photo DK Bhaskar There is more Over the years Delhi has emerged as a major hub for the illegal shahtoosh shawl trade Shops in upscale hotels and private residential areas store the shawls mostly for foreign buyers who often smuggle the contraband out with their personal baggage for sale to the fashion capitals of the world It is estimated that in the first three months of 1999 enforcement officials in Delhi confiscated 290 shawls some from the international airport itself In February 2001 70 shahtoosh shawls were confiscated from a location in South Delhi Starting September 26 2001 the authorities seized 460 kg of shahtoosh wool in three separate incidents within the span of a month And the Wildlife Department of Delhi recovered 215 kg of pure shahtoosh wool in April 2003 from a truck while it was on its way to Majnu ka Tila the infamous residential area of Tibetan migrants It is extremely difficult to nab the culprits but over a span of four days the Central Bureau of Investigation in a meticulously planned operation recovered 21 shawls and arrested five traders in November 2005 It is not difficult to fathom what drives people to trade in wildlife goods Huge profit margins and a limitless demand had turned a casual business into an organised wholesale business Single sourcing supplies on demand and stacking in warehouses are characteristics of this organised trade In early 2005 the Special Staff of the Central Police district in New Delhi arrested Sudesh Kumar near the Ramlila grounds and in his possession was an uncured leopard skin He sang Sudhesh Kumars disclosures led the police to the notorious Gali No 10 in Sadar Bazaar to the home of Sansar Chand from where his daughter was arrested She had in her possession as many as one snow leopard seven leopard and two tiger skins Investigations further led the police to ShadiKhampur where a veritable super mall of grizzly contraband was unearthed involving 30 leopard and 42 otter skins three kilogrammes of tiger nails 14 tiger teeth 20 tiger claws 10 tiger jaws 60 kg of leopard claws and 135 kg porcupine quills This was part of the uncontrolled empire of the notorious wildlife trafficker Sansar Chand who takes delivery orders on telephone and supplies the products of choice to voracious international customers In April 2005 the Timarpur police apprehended three NepaliTibetan nationals as they waited to board a bus to Nepal and recovered 45 leopard and 14 otter skins They said the skins were procured from Sansar Chand and that they were transporting them to Kathmandu as instructed by one Chhewang a Nepalese citizen who however escaped to Nepal After issuance of an Interpol Red Corner Notice and in a classic example of bilateral cooperation Chhewang was eventually arrested by the authorities in December 2005 by the Nepalese Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation DNPWC Sansar Chand took advantage of Indias low enforcement priority to expand his dark empire In a long criminal history that spans three decades he concentrated on trading tiger and leopard skins which a ready market with huge profit margins Photo Nature Conservation Society Amravati A third major haul was recorded in early February 2006 a year when a CID team from the Rajasthan Police were investigating the tiger poaching incidents in Ranthambhore The team camped in Delhi for several days before apprehending Nema Tshering alias Khampa a Tibetan national living in Nepal In his possession were 34 freshlytanned leopard and four otter skins The consignment had come to Delhi from Allahabad by a goods parcel and was destined for Siliguri for onward transmission to Nepal Delhi is a transit point for illegal wildlife products Skins from different parts of the country reach Delhi and are then sent on to different destinations primarily the border towns of Nepal in concealed packets by rail or road and very rarely through couriers Investigation into one of the biggest seizures of skins at Ghaziabad on the night of December 18 1999 revealed that the consignment of 50 leopard three tiger and five otter skins that had originated in Khaga had transited through Delhi on its way to Siliguri on the IndoNepal border A parcel containing 50 leopard and 15 otter skins recovered in the warehouse of a transport company at Haldwani in Uttaranchal in May 2000 had been booked from the capital Delhi also records the only instance of simultaneous seizure of a leopard skin and nearly four kilogrammes of charas from two accused in April 2000 indicating possible convergence of crime The uncrowned king of the illegal wildlife empire in Delhi over the years has been Sansar Chand Initiated into the trade way back in 1974 when he was just 12 Sansar has never looked back Inheriting the trade as a family profession and operating from Delhis Sadar precincts he took advantage of Indias low enforcement priority to expand his dark empire In a long criminal history that spans three decades he has been implicated in more than 20 registered offences of which only two wound up in convictions While his first conviction was upheld by the Hon Supreme Court he was released on probation since he was a juvenile at the time the crime was committed The second conviction came as long as 20 years later and in this case he managed to evade an actual sentence for over a year during the pendency of his appeal In this period of time he never lost a moment utilising his freedom to solidify his criminal empire by expanding his network to more wildlife sanctuaries and national parks It has been suggested that he has also been neutralising professional rivals and revels in the epithet he earned of being the Veerappan of the North Some important milestones in his bloody career are revealing In March 1988 the Seelampur police recovered about 26000 snakeskins 2000 small cat skins and some tiger skins from the house of one Maqbool During his interrogation he revealed that the owner of the contraband was actually Sansar Chand The Sawai Madhopur Police in Rajasthan recovered a large consignment of tiger bones and skeletons in 1992 and investigations revealed that these too belonged to Sansar Then in 1995 the Hardwar police and forest officials recovered leopard skins in two separate seizures and investigations proved that they belonged to Sansar Chand In January 2003 leopard skins were seized from a man called Balwan aboard the Chetak Express at the Bhilwara railway station No prizes for guessing where they were to be delivered Sansar Chand at Delhi Arrests of carriers led to still more arrests and to fresh leads The Manek Chowk Police in Jaipur effected a huge seizure of leopard skins and miscellaneous contraband in October 2004 and again the involvement of Sansar Chand and his family emerged This man had virtually become a oneman army against Indian wildlife Sansar Chand took advantage of Indias low enforcement priority to expand his dark empire In a long criminal history that spans three decades he concentrated on trading tiger and leopard skins which a ready market with huge profit margins Photo BK Sharma The most important characteristic of this criminal footprint is that very rarely was there an actual recovery from Sansar Chand himself As a result he managed to obtain bail with surprising ease Another feature that emerged was his penchant for trading in tiger and leopard skins that had ready buyers and which offered him very lucrative profit margins The trade was exclusivist in nature mainly confined to Nepali and Tibetan bulk buyers The primary supply sources were the Samalakhabased Bawaria poaching gangs of Haryana The mode of delivery ranged from personal meetings to parcel packets by rail or road Sansar Chand who places secrecy and reliability at a premium tends to trust his own relatives much more than others Consequently more and more family members began to get caught in traps laid for them A characteristic of his dealings was that he collected and paid advance payment in cash for supplies This worked down the line where the actual poacher most often a local villager in search of quick cash would be given money with instructions to get back in touch when the goods were ready There is no reliable estimate of Sansar Chands real worth but his illgotten gains have been ploughed into acquiring both movable and immovable properties After years of seeing him thumb his nose at the police sustained efforts by enforcement agencies saw Sansar nailed by the Delhi Police on June 30 2005 from Patel Nagar He was remanded to the custody of the Central Bureau of Investigation CBI As a result of meticulous investigations that revealed his connection with hardcore organised crime for the first time in the history of wildlife enforcement the CBI invoked the provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act MCOCA as extended to the NCT of Delhi against him and members of his crime syndicate This time he was unable to escape prison and has since been incarcerated in jail as the investigation into his crime empire continue apace The arrest of Sansar Chand has certainly proved to be a strong deterrent It has demonstrated that law will ultimately catch up with the toughest most elusive offender But has the removal of one of the biggest players brought down the extent of wildlife crime qualitatively and quantitatively in Delhi and other places The statistics of seizures for what they are worth unfortunately do not support such a notion What the statistics suggest is that rather than go after individuals we must target the system Indias laws are fairly stringent and compare well with any international legislation Where we fail is onground enforcement There have been many impressive seizures yet the quality of subsequent investigation has not been up to scratch Consequently we have lost the deterrence of prompt arrest and even when arrests are made the ease with which bail is obtained gives hardened criminals and new recruits the impression that they will literally be above the law if they are caught Then there is the problem of witnesses turning hostile which often leads to acquittals All cases under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 are instituted in the courts on the basis of Complaints not Chargesheets This delays trial because of statutory formalities of precharge evidence for long A little finetuning and even minor procedural changes could multiply the lethality of the statute while an institutionalised coordinated approach on the part of enforcement agencies could vastly increase their efficacy Forensic support for investigations need drastic improvement and enforcement officials need to be exposed to the latest techniques and scientific advances by way of exposure and training to international standards Intelligence and access to reliable databanks are the sine qua non of an effective enforcement regime which we need to develop through the establishment of the proposed National Wildlife Crime Control Bureau Enhanced bilateral cooperation with China and Nepal would be another nail in the coffin of the wildlife trade which looks upon our borders as nonexistent not just porous It is not as though we do not know what to do For instance organised syndicates could begin to be dismantled through the forfeiture of illegallyacquired property professional investigations and successful prosecution would further cripple the trade which is actually not being run by either capable or clever people All that enforcement agencies need is to work in unison and to a plan All this is of course easier said than done though some simple but vital steps could deliver a qualitative change in the existing enforcement regime Nevertheless we have little choice but to push ahead with the options available to us With Sariska now empty of tigers and other forests such as Ranthambhore and Tadoba under attack the mere arrest of one Sansar Chand though crucial cannot hope to stem the bloody tide because literally hundreds of budding young Sansar Chands are waiting in the wings to take advantage of this lucrative lethal trade Animal Underworld An Excerpt From a New Book Black Market On The Wildlife Trade In Endangered Species in Asia Of all the countries in Asia China is the biggest destination for illegal wildlife It is the worlds largest consumer of ivory importing as much as fifteen tons each year the equivalent of fifteen hundred dead elephants China swallows up more than half of the ten thousand tons of freshwater turtles traded annually in the region It is the biggest market for tiger bone leopard cat rhino horn and sea horse As an old Chinese proverb says the nation consumes everything with its back to the sky The magnitude of the problem is staggering In 2001 China claimed a population of 13 billion That is roughly five times the population of the United States Nearly one out of every four humans lives in China Growing prosperity has brought undreamed of buying power to the masses If just 02 percent of the Chinese population earned enough money to buy a single bear gall bladder it would take all the bears in North America to supply them China is like a vacuum cleaner says James Compton at TRAFFIC an organisation that monitors the illegal trade in the region It is the single greatest threat to wildlife in the whole of Asia While it is easy to point the finger at China there are plenty of other culprits The US is the biggest buyer of exotic pets in the world Nearly seven million households own a pet bird and a further four million own a pet snake turtle or iguana Japan is a major purchaser of ivory Taiwan and Korea have also used their immense wealth to acquire wild animals or products from around the region The supply routes begin far from these developed nations in some of the poorest and most remote parts of the region Here the forests are still relatively intact and rare animals are easily obtainable With just a few village contacts a friend in the customs department and the liberal dispensation of cash almost anything is possible Indonesia lies at the start of the trail Rich in wildlife but impoverished in every other way it comprises more than 17000 islands each of which can be used to ship out animals for profit From this heavily populated archipelago tens of thousands of pangolins parrots and other native species are illegally traded every year Orangutans once numbering hundreds of thousands are now sufficiently rare that this species is likely to be the first great ape to become extinct in modern times So many Sumatran tigers have been poached that less than 500 remain in the wild a population that many believe is unsustainable Indonesias problems are immense says Compton But at least there is recognition from the government that something needs to be done This is always the first step towards stopping the trade India is another of the major suppliers sending elephants tigers and rhino horn to Nepal Burma China and Tibet During the 1970s under the watchful eye of its Prime Minister Indira Gandhi India clamped down heavily on the trade which allowed populations of tigers and rhinos to rebound That period ended when Gandhi was assassinated With its long and porous borders and poor enforcement India today provides easy pickings for wildlife traffickers attracted by some of Asias last great strongholds of rare mammals But suppliers of wild animals need middlemen to facilitate trade and transport Thats where more developed countries like Malaysia Thailand and Singapore fill the void Thailand was once a major supplier Having killed many of its own wild animals it has now found an equally lucrative role as a transit centre where middlemen buy and sell wildlife from neighbouring countries In Malaysia and Singapore the trade also flourishes Under a veneer of cooperation the nations shipping ports airports and borders are sieves allowing vast amounts of wildlife to be channelled in and out of the countries Smugglers identify the loose links of the chain says a former enforcement officer for the US government Their objective is to move illegal shipments with the minimum cost and the lowest risk Its like gems or drugs or oil Its about controlling the supply routes Formerly staunch communist countries like Laos and Vietnam have become the newest links in the supply chain funnelling wildlife over their porous borders into China To avoid the more heavily enforced land routes smugglers use private planes to fly consignments of turtles and pangolins from Kuala Lumpur the Malaysian capital to Vientiane in Laos From this unregulated wildlife hub they are sent by truck to the Vietnamese border Shipments are also transported by boat from Indonesia to Vietnam often transiting through intermediate destinations to avoid unwarranted attention When officials at one border crossing clamp down on the underground channels another one opens up to take the slack In the face of this global onslaught the response from the authorities has been wholly inadequate The loopholes available to traffickers and the weak penalties meted out to those caught only serve to facilitate the trafficking of animals In order to contain the trade governments have to hit the big players who control the major routes and who are often protected by politicians So far the powersthatbe have not done so In a small crowded shop in the Tsukiji district near Tokyos famous Fish Market the scale and international reach of the trade is hard to ignore Surrounded by mounted deer heads giant turtle shells and piles of ginseng a stuffed polar bear wrapped in polyethylene is on sale with a price tag of US 11000 The polar bear supposedly came from Alaska although in the wildlife trade it is hard to corroborate such claims Stuffed tigers black pumas and leopards are also up for grabs For US 408000 the shop will even sell a stuffed giant panda over the Internet Asked about the blatant display and sale of endangered species Mr Itoi the vendor says that he has no problems with the police Buying one or two items will not hurt at all he says There is no way you will be in trouble The same however is not true of the giant panda Recently seven people in China were executed

Indias most knowledgeable and experienced experts on the lethal illegal wildlife trade He was awarded a Sanctuary Wildlife Service Award in 2005 for exemplary work done in protecting wildlife and writes frequently for sanctuary He reveals here the shocking scale at which wildlife contraband traders use the internet with impunity at the cost of rare and endangered species W hen Hisayoshi Kojima the Indiana Jones of butterfly smugglers offered my friend Ed Newcomer a special agent of the US Fish and Wildlife Services posted in Los Angeles a giant swallowtail Papilio homerus its velvety black and gold wings are depicted on Jamaicas 1000 bank notes the Luzon peacock swallowtail Papilio chikae from the Philippines and the prized Queen Alexandras birdwing from Papua New Guinea little did he realise that he was already in the trap laid by Newcomer If the Internet had made wildlife crime easier for Kojima it had also guised Newcomer to pose as a potential customer using a fictitious email For years Kojima had been involved in widespread trafficking of endangered and CITESprotected butterflies which he would obtain from nearly every continent for highend collectors in the US Investigators found that most of Kojimas advertising and sale was done through a website he maintained in Kyoto Japan Newcomer established contact and purchased a pair of Ornithoptera alexandrae for 8500 Kojima offered to sell him hundreds of endangered butterflies valued at 294000 Newcomer communicated through a Voice Over Internet Programme VOIP called Skype and Kojima showed him the rarest butterflies for sale from his Kyoto home through a webcam All the conversations were recorded on audio and video Newcomer made numerous purchases from Kojima and each was smuggled to USA under false US Customs declarations Newcomer obtained a 17 count indictment against Kojima for smuggling and violation of the Endangered Species Act He finally lured Kojima to Los Angeles USA where he was arrested at the airport on July 31 2006 He pleaded guilty to all the charges and was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison and fined 38731 in April 2007 This was a success story but even such stories sadly are the exceptions not the rule All too many criminals get away undetected Ivory items above come at a great cost Elephants are brutally killed to supply this deadly trade According to IFAWs investigations more than 90 per cent of the wildlife products being auctioned violated the minimal ivory listing regulations of the respective eBay website The recent eBay announcement of a complete ban on online auction of ivory in the wake of COP 14 is a welcome step Photo IFAW A study by the Humane Society of the United States in 2002 revealed that nearly 900 ivory pieces were listed for sale on eBay every single day The Wildlife Conservation Society reported in State of the Wild 2006 that 1000 ivory items were advertised on eBay for sale per week between February and May 2004 In April 2004 Traffic Europes study revealed a tremendous increase in the amount of Russian caviar offered on sale illegally on the Internet On monitoring the nature and scale of the wildlife trade for just five types of products and live animals on Englishlanguage websites in the United Kingdom the International Fund for Animal Welfare IFAW discovered that over 9000 wild animal products specimens and live wild animals were available per week The list included 5527 individual elephant products including an elephants foot as a barstool 146 live animals including a sevenyearold gorilla a Siberian pet tiger and a twoyearold sweetnatured giraffe As many as 526 turtle products from 25 listed traders or exporters and 2630 items derived from reptiles and 239 wild cat products that included lion cheetah leopard bobcat lynx ocelot caracal and puma were available for sale In October 2006 IFAWs monthlong study of private and commercial legal and illegal trade in wild animals on Dutchlanguage websites detected 150 sites selling endangered species of mammals land tortoises sea turtles protected birds reptiles and amphibians IFAW also investigated the online portal Marktplaats an eBay subsidiary site in the Netherlands during the same time and found 8000 offers of endangered species of wild birds alone each day They may sound horrific but these statistics are little more than the proverbial tip of the iceberg There has been no survey of similar sales on the hundreds of websites in different languages worldwide The studies are primarily confined to auction sites and do not take into account the illegal trade that occurs through mailing lists and secured websites Nonetheless the studies suggest the extent and magnitude of the illegal trade Though impossible to quantify there is no denying that the illegal wildlife trade on the Internet is alive and well and growing by the minute How to kill an elephant with a mouse All ivory and other wildlife items you see here were found on eBay websites worldwide Cyber laws vary greatly across countries as do the guidelines issued by auction sites such as eBay The world wide web has become the worlds biggest marketplace for illicit trade in wildlife a trade so huge that it is second only to the trade in illegal arms and drugs The Nature Of The Trade The singlemost important factor fuelling the wildlife trade on the Internet is anonymity While many sites are completely anonymous or used with pseudonyms in other cases privacy laws of countries protect users to the extent that law enforcement agencies cannot intercept communications except through elaborate and timeconsuming legal procedures that sellers are always able to outwit Such sellers furnish fake names and addresses and are almost impossible to identify They change email accounts frequently and even use cold servers Communications that begin in open fora often shift to private discussions through untraceable emails discussion boards message boards or chat rooms where the real deals are struck Buyers take similar precautions making it virtually impossible for any investigation to pinpoint the offenders The Internet has the biggest customer base in the world It has converted the world into a virtual market place where a crocodile boot offered for sale in Mexico lands up with a customer in Japan or a shahtoosh shawl from India in the USA The famous eBay site with 33 national subsidiaries is the single biggest auction site that provides a global online marketplace where practically anyone can trade practically anything Millions of items get listed everyday on eBay which is used as a trading platform by over 222 million registered users eBay India has a community of over two million registered users across over 670 towns and approximately 12800 sellers use the site as a primary or secondary source of income wwwkingsnakecom which deals with herpetological businesses provides links to 270 commercial reptile breeders and many importers exporters and retail stores wwwwaterwolvescom and wwwaquabidcom have enormous client bases that trade in fish species The speed of transactions in Internet trading is an added advantage Sales that once required personal meetings over several days now take place at the click on a keyboard Records of such electronic transactions are shortlived Even if a court order is available it is difficult to get email details from a service provider for a period beyond 30 days The money trail is of course notoriously difficult to establish because of the frequent electronic transfers across varying accounts Advertising a product on the Internet is normally very inexpensive But auction sites like eBay charge low or no listing fees and take only a small percentage of the sale price Independent sites are easy to set up and inexpensive to maintain The fact that investigations are inevitably cumbersome and relatively ineffective makes the use of the Internet even more attractive to criminals What is more cyber laws vary greatly across countries as do the guidelines issued by auction sites such as eBay By claiming antiquity sellers manage to avoid site intervention while in many instances it is impossible to verify the legality of the furnished document By and large investigating agencies including police and forest officials in countries such as India lack familiarity with cyber investigations and all too often website administrators quoting privacy concerns refuse to supply complete information even after a legal notice has been served on them In truth there is virtually no institutional mechanism to patrol the dark cyber world to proactively search for and detect violations Police or forest officials must therefore wait for complaints to turn up on their tables and this is understandably a very ineffective way to investigate crime Success Stories The case of Hisayoshi Kojima as I mentioned at the start of this piece was an exception For us to enhance our capacity to deal with criminals who use the Internet requires constant consistent and innovative methods plus unprecedented cooperation between law enforcement agencies across nations Predictably so far most countries have had a low enforcement success rate but every success teaches us something and every failure points us in the right direction for future cases A joint investigation by Canadian and US authorities against Mark Gleberzon of Toronto who had indulged in a series of unlawful transactions involving endangered species on a popular Internetbased auction site led to his conviction in October 2006 On a tipoff from the US Fish and Wildlife Services in December 2006 the Brazilian police seized 60 tarantulas two scorpions and a turtle intended for sale on the Internet by Eduardo Galhardo of Sao Paolo Based on information received from NWCIU police in Norfolk UK seized a computer and several CITESlisted species from the house of Mark Rowland Investigations proved numerous transactions on eBay and other auction sites for over a year of protected species Rowland was convicted in December 2005 and sentenced to eight months in custody Cases of offer of sale of shahtoosh shawls and even a tiger skin had been detected on bazeecom in India These instances were however not properly investigated Regulatory Strategies Such examples of detection and successful prosecution of offenders are few and far between There are not too many investigators who would patiently conduct a covert operation for several months to track down one wildlife offender who might in any event be based in another country Because cyber laws differ from country to country extradition or deportation of foreign nationals for investigation or trial is difficult The capacity to conduct cyber investigation is woefully inadequate in most countries Internet Service Providers ISPs claim themselves as mere conduits and take no responsibility for the content of the sites they host The bland selfregulation claims by site owners especially auction sites are often unreliable The end result is that despite evidence and an enhanced recognition of the problem the Internet is probably now the most widelyused medium for illegal wildlife trafficking The Way Ahead The Internet will govern our lives in more ways than one in the days to come and the illegal wildlife trade is bound to increase with the growth of the Internet unless effective regulatory mechanisms are put in place Site owners have to initiate voluntary action to prohibit or remove attempts to buy or sell wildlife contraband One site eBay must strictly enforce its animal and wildlife products policy across the board in all the countries it operates in Other auction sites must adopt similar policies and ensure strict enforcement The recent eBay announcement of a complete ban on online auction of elephant ivory in the wake of COP 14 was a very welcome step Website owners need to establish effective reporting mechanisms to allow users to report any suspicious items Effective institutional systems to report infractions of the law to enforcement agencies by users site owners and bodies like the Internet Watch Foundation need to be devised Wildlife NGOs can also play a crucial role in encouraging reporting either directly or through them In the event of lack of action one can use sites like wwwsaferindiacom recently launched by super excop Kiran Bedi to enforce police intervention The storage period of data by ISPs needs to be increased if necessary through legislative enactments And surely the system of data supply to enforcement officials must be less cumbersome Awareness about the problem both among the general public and enforcement officials will only rise through sustained public campaigns and private efforts It goes without saying that world police bodies such as the International Criminal Police Organisation ICPO or Interpol can play an extremely significant role in training enforcement officials and facilitating countrytocountry cooperation for investigation and exchange of information as was done in the case of cyber child pornography The decision at the recentlyconcluded COP 14 at The Hague Netherlands to convene a workshop during the current year of CITES member countries and experts should be implemented urgently Management Authorities enforcement officials Internet trade experts website owners and ISPs together with representatives of NGOs must sit together to discuss the scope of the Internet wildlife trade its impact on CITES implementation and the best way to implement enforcement The line If the buying stops the killing will too is all too true and it is time we defanged the most convenient hypermall for illegal trade in endangered species the Internet Note The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of Sanctuary Asia the Sanctuary Nature Foundation or its Editors First

hunt is not a pretty story In fact it is downright disturbing particularly to those who understand that traditions based on the existence of virtually endless forests are now adding to the press of extinction for species whose habitats have been whittled down by urban demands including mines dams roads and altered land use T he call came in on December 16 2011 at 245 pm A group of Santhal tribals from the Hooghly district of West Bengal were about to embark on a wild cat hunt I had long heard of these hunts and was curious to know why they hunted and what their modus operandi was On joining them I realised that my mental picture of tribals was completely outdated Yes they were Santhals classified as a Scheduled Tribe in India Yet their attire was no different from most of us By the time I caught up with them the group had already identified the burrow of an animal which was being closely inspected for clues Three young boys were part of the hunting team but they said that they were not really there to learn how to hunt rather they just wanted to experience the thrill of the chase Once they established that the burrow was actually occupied by an animal they began piling up dry leaves and other vegetation on the entrance The idea was to smoke the animal out into the open and identify other emergency exits Sure enough the telltale smoke revealed another strategic exit which was promptly guarded by men armed with sharp sticks In addition to sticks Santhali hunters use unique bows and arrows with the string drawn from bamboo strips not the intestine of an animal The arrow tips are crafted from cheap cast iron Machetes and spears are thrust into the burrows of unsuspecting animals until the animal has no choice but to leave its hideout The hunting team crowds around the burrow ensuring that there is no escape route for the animal From their vantage point they can see the hapless cat thrashing about in its burrow and can anticipate its next move The hunt I noticed was all about patience The men had no option but to wait for the animal to emerge In between they would thrust a spear deep inside the burrow in all directions and then inspect the metal tip for signs of blood or fur To confirm that the burrow was actually occupied a thin stick was inserted into the hideout and if it moved the animal was clearly at home In this case the animal refused to be flushed out so the group began to dig into the burrow with eyes trained on all possible escape exits Soon the hapless animal could be seen moving desperately about below the soil and its head and face were visible It was a jungle cat Felis chaus The group made way for their best spear man while another wielded an axe as back up The cat bit on the metal shaft of the spear in a vain bid to escape But it had no chance at all The spear did its job ruthlessly quickly And a magnificent creature was lost in the name of tradition and festivity With the spear still embedded in its belly swift blows to the head with a bamboo pole were administered to make sure it was dead I had gone willingly to witness the whole process but was shattered by the casual ease and was left wondering how many such traditional hunts across our country continued to take a daily toll on our vanishing wildlife The hunting party of Santhals first identified the burrow of an animal and closely inspected it for clues and prepared their game plan These three boys who came with the hunting group claimed to have joined just for fun Hunting they say is all about patience and the thrill of the chase The goal is no longer sustenance it is only for the adrenalin rush of a successful hunt What can be done I run a wildlife conservation NGO Simultala Conservationists which seeks to create awareness on the issue of snake bites wild animal rescues and to offer education to rural communities on conservation We also try to engage and dissuade tribal communities from indulging in such hunts In 2008 I had confronted a large hunting party of Santhals at the Nalikul Railway Station in the Hooghly district of West Bengal Six adult wild jungle cats three lessthanonemonth old jungle cat cubs and one mongoose were confiscated from them The problem of bush meat collection cannot be curbed leave alone stopped by the mere promulgation of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 I took the hunting party to the nearest police station hoping it might intimidate them but it had little or no effect The hunters knew nothing about the Wildlife Protection Act or why a particular species was listed or why its conservation was important One Santhali boy asked me what I was doing about wild cats that they saw run over by vehicles each year probably twice the number the Santhali hunted in the same amount of time I had no answer After seizing their hunting equipment and their days trophies I filed a report with the Forest Department Officer in my area informing him that an autopsy of all the animals killed would be carried out the next day under the supervision of a Government Veterinary Surgeon The autopsy performed by Dr Gautam Kumar Nandy at Nalikul was an education unto itself In 2008 the author had confronted a large hunting party of Santhals at the Nalikul Railway Station in the Hooghly district of West Bengal Six adult wild jungle cats three lessthanonemonth old jungle cat cubs and one mongoose were confiscated from them Autopsy reports revealed that 85 per cent of the stomach content of these wild cats contained rodent bones highlighting their role in keeping the rodent population under control The carcass revealed rodent bones that highlighted the role of wild cats in controlling rodents in and around agricultural fields I have kept track of such autopsies and found that 85 per cent of the stomach content of wild cats contained rodent bones A major problem with the hunting traditions of the Santhali tribes of West Bengal is the fact that their hunts coincide with the breeding season of wild cats Without let or hindrance nursing mothers or pregnant females even kittens are slaughtered I guess there is really no way to stop this At best we can engage them explain to the younger lot about the true impact of what they are doing while simultaneously working to ensure that their youth are educated and gainfully employed Note The views expressed in this

headed Ibises lie dead on the floor Scattered among the carcasses of birds are smaller mammals monitor lizards Indian hares jungle cats palm civets and even jackals This is Puducherry or Pondicherry specifically a small stretch of road between Villianur and Koodapakkam S Prasad writes here of thousands of wild animals meeting a grisly end every year Thousands of birds are caught every week from the Oussudu Lake Bird Sanctuary and sold for their meat at roadside stalls on Koodapakkam road Odiampet road junction and Villianur road These shaky images taken from a moving motorcycle to avoid physical threats from the perpetrators of this trade are enough to give any wildlife enthusiast or indeed anyone concerned about Indias ecological future sleepless nights Death in Oussudu O ussudu is home to countless migratory birds that visit between October and May plus a host of resident birds and mammals many highly endangered which survive here all year round Their nemesis is a nomadic tribe the Narikuravas who struggle in vain but with deadly effect to lift themselves from poverty by stripping this biodiverse region of its animals Interestingly the name Narikuravas means the jackal people derived from their uncanny ability to trap the elusive animal Jackals are trapped by building a netted enclosure whereupon the hunters mimic the calls of a jackal Inquisitive to a fault the jackals tend to approach close to the net where they are clubbed to death Also called Kuruvikaran the bird men these extremely effective hunters traditionally used domesticated partridges as decoys to attract wild ones which are then caught and sold for meat Today they live close to the sanctuary enter surreptitiously at dusk and use countrymade guns to telling effect Food laced with the banned pesticide Endosulfan is also dusted on water plants which quickly kills unsuspecting birds and causes the death of an untold number of aquatic organisms The heartbreaking sight of these baby parakeets torn from their homes is only one of the devastating scenes witnessed by the author The plunder of Oussudu must stop to the benefit of both people and wildlife Photo S Prasad Laws exist to prevent such hunting practices including fines of Rs 25000 or imprisonment or both But the only ones caught are hapless wild species The hunters manage to get away scotfree despite bringing down hundreds of birds every day Prices for the contraband range from Rs100 a kg for Great Egrets and Purple Moorhens to Rs 400 to Rs 500 per kg for Spotbilled Pelicans Grey Herons Asian Openbills and Blackheaded Ibises Additionally monitor lizards and Indian hare fetch over Rs 600 per kilo A local ornithologist on condition of anonymity told the author We got hold of several birds including the Common Coot Purple Moorhen and Spotbilled Duck recently by interacting with the Narikurava tribes and pretending to buy them Though the author alerted the Forest Department it turned counterproductive with the officials berating us and abusing us for repeatedly and needlessly reporting such issues So who buys the birds Local villagers blissfully unaware that with this bush meat they are ingesting deadly toxins that could kill their own families When contacted the Deputy Conservator of Forests Anil Kumar said that the Forest Department had in fact arrested some Narikuravas for poaching a few times but the tribals said they had no other source of income Following recent articles on the poaching the Forest Department has undertaken some raids and seized the birds However no arrests have been made nor weaponstraps seized Food laced with the banned pesticide Endosulfan is dusted on water plants which quickly kills unsuspecting birds Local villagers are blissfully unaware that with this bush meat they are ingesting deadly toxins that could kill their own families Photograph by S Prasad Light at the end of the tunnel With poaching on the rise and the number of birds steadily dwindling it is only a matter of time before the poaching comes to an end because there will be no more birds left It is therefore in the interests of both wild animals and the Narikuravas that alternative employment opportunities be found for them Like all other indigenous communities around the world Narikuravas have incredible insights into the ways of nature their knowledge of wildlife and their talents could be put to such good use as field staff for the Forest Department Skilled craftsman they could also very easily produce bead jewellery and other artifacts through selfhelp groups that could wean them away from their deadly livelihoods Away from the national spotlight the fate of both the wildlife of Oussudu and the future of the Narikuravas depends on how quickly we are able to negotiate and implement an effective solution Note The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of Sanctuary Asia the Sanctuary Nature Foundation or its

its members in any poaching of rhinos He also led the police to Dimapur in Nagaland long identified as a major hub in the illegal wildlife trade only to find that the main buyer believed to be a Chinese national had fled The increasing use of automatic weapons such as AK series rifles in recent poaching incidents has only reinforced the active interest and participation of militant groups in the illegal wildlife trade But then this is not the first time such linkages have come to light In the eighties several important Protected Areas in Assam such as the Laukhowa Wildlife Sanctuary and Manas National Park lost their rhinos allegedly to local militant outfits that saw this as an easy option to raise money for their activities In 2001 while conducting an investigation into elephant poaching in the Corbett Tiger Reserve several sources in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh had voiced their concerns to this author on the close links of some of these poaching outfits to militant groups across the Myanmar border and the barter trade in wildlife and weapons amongst them The illegal wildlife trade is no longer small sporadic and inconsequential In its new avatar it is like any other mainstream criminal activity wellorganised wellfunded ruthless and transnational Wildlife Mafias In the early 2000s the CITES Secretariat in close collaboration with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime UNODC identified key indicators that clearly illustrated the involvement of organised crime in illicit wildlife trafficking These included detailed planning significant financial support use of threat of violence international management of shipments sophisticated forgery and alteration of permits and certifications wellarmed participants with the latest weapons and opportunity for massive profits Given the very high profits from such illicit activities along with the relatively low probability of detection poor conviction rates and light punishment received by those convicted these crimes are very appealing to professional organised criminals They find the wildlife trade less risky than other highvalue black markets including the narcotics trade because the penalties associated with wildlife crime tend to be substantially less severe while the profits are comparable to other crimes Globally such signs have been long recognised Criminals engaged in the illicit trade in tiger and bear products between the Russian Federation and China are known to collaborate with the Russian mafia to smuggle contraband across the border A large part of the illegal trade in caviar is also believed to be controlled by the Russian mafia A 2008 report of the US Congressional Research Service prepared for members and committees of the US Congress acknowledges links of wildlife crime to other organised crime It also mentions that numerous sources point out that organised criminal syndicates insurgency groups and military units are among the primary actors involved in largescale commercialsized wildlife trafficking A typical market day in Mong La Shan State in Myanmar where tiger paws teeth and other wildlife body parts are available for sale Surveys by TRAFFIC the wildlife trade monitoring network revealed skin and bones canines and claws from almost 200 wild cats including at least 107 tigers in Myanmars wildlife markets Photo Dan Bennett FotercomCC BY Plants on the List Its not just horns and skins that are traded Red sanders a timber species endemic to India is being smuggled out to China and other destinations in Southeast Asia and East Asia Many a time forged custom papers are used sometimes the consignment is concealed and misdeclared In one case the seals of the container were replaced and the contents changed in another the entire container was replaced with one carrying the same serial numbers All this clearly reveals a level of planning on the part of criminal rings that must surely be a cause of worry for enforcement officials Very little is known about the trade in medicinal and aromatic plants MAPs across Indias borders but anyone looking carefully enough will come across indications of rampant misdeclaration Many highvalue and regulated species find their way out under the name of common species Globally the value of the illegal wildlife trade has been estimated by various agencies and experts to be between US 520 billion annually making it one of the most lucrative international criminal enterprises However as the UNODC points out in a recent report the environmental impact of this crime is much greater than the relatively small income it generates for criminals Testifying at a hearing of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee in May 2012 John E Scanlon SecretaryGeneral of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES stated that INTERPOL and the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice have both recognised the increasing involvement of organised crime syndicates in wildlife crime Militant involvement The role of armed rebel militias in organised poaching and trafficking of wildlife is also increasingly being reported from various parts of the globe Adrian Levy and Cathy ScottClark writing for the Guardian UK in May 2007 mentioned that militants affiliated to alQaida with bases in Bangladesh are operating in the vicinity of important wildlife areas in some of Indias Northeastern states Their links with organised crime syndicates in China Nepal and Thailand are wellknown Many men behind this illegal trade often Bangladeshi in origin are linked to militant groups in need of money and are eager to get into this trade The names of HarkatulJihadalIslami HuJI and Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh were mentioned in the article In September 2012 world leaders at the sixtyseventh annual meeting of the UN General Assembly voiced concern about poaching and the illicit trafficking of wildlife products as severe threats to the rule of law governance and economic development The US as a Permanent Security Council member concurred about the harm caused by wildlife poaching and trafficking to conservation efforts rule of law governance and economic development France emphasised the severity and negative impacts of wildlife crime One of the strongest indictments came from Gabons President Ali Bongo who said Such organised crime is increasingly affecting the environment and biodiversity through poaching and illegal fishing Gabon intends to strengthen its criminal justice system to combat this phenomenon But such efforts will require a greater international legal cooperationIn response to record levels of elephant poaching in Africa President Bongo directed the burning of Gabons seized ivory stockpile in 2012 after a full audit supported by the World Wide Fund for Nature WWF and TRAFFIC the wildlife trade monitoring network The tremors of this illicit economy are increasingly felt across the globe At the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES CoP16 held in Bangkok Thailand on March 3 and 4 2013 member states addressed a widerange of issues including ensuring highlevel political engagement enhancing international cooperation coordinating enforcement support at global regional and national levels deploying a wider range of operational techniques and enhancing enforcement effectiveness More recently on April 26 2013 the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice CCPCJ the central body within the UN dealing with crime prevention and criminal justice policy adopted a draft resolution on Crime prevention and criminal justice responses to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild fauna and flora Chinese tourists often travel to Myanmar to eat at restaurants where you can choose live wildlife that range from sun bears and pangolins to snakes kept in cages on the sidewalk and then ask the chef to kill and cook it Most are endangered species from Myanmars vast tracts of virgin forest though some are even trafficked from as far away as India and Nepal Photo Dan Bennett Fotercom The Indian Position In India at the state level it is primarily the Forest Departments that must address such threats However they are not fully attuned to or adequately prepared to meet the new dangers that such crimes present to national security Besides the Forest Departments and most other agencies have little orientation as to the serious nature of such wildlife crimes And they lack the training and experience critical to counter such crime effectively In the absence of intelligencedriven enforcement theirs is largely a hitormiss affair Nor are their levels of institutional support any real match for the highrisk players on the wildlife crime roulette circuit A visit to most antipoaching camps across the country reflects this lack of priority and poor infrastructure Arms and ammunition if provided are not sufficiently backed by legal and administrative protocols for their use leading to situations where staff has refused to carry weapons provided to them for fear of reprisal Despite Indias rich biodiversity and the harsh challenges faced by frontline staff and field officers there is no nationallevel reward andor acknowledgement for those who constitute the nations first line of defence against the plunderers of our natural bounty For the police and other agencies in the law enforcement business wildlife crimes are perhaps at the bottom of the priority ladder Yes there are signs of changed attitudes in recent times but not nearly fast enough to make a significant dent in the illegal wildlife trade Nevertheless India is the first country in the region to have established a Wildlife Crime Control Bureau at the national level though the Bureau is still in its infancy Agencies like the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence DRI of the Department of Customs have done some valuable work in tracking such wildlife criminals and disrupting their networks Hopefully we will see more cooperation and coordination among enforcement agencies Clearly these cameos by themselves are not enough The highest levels of law enforcement administration in the country need to clearly acknowledge the severe threat that illegal wildlife crime poses to national security and gear up all institutions and agencies to respond appropriately Collaboration with neighbouring countries which serve as transit points and markets for wildlife products from India is vital The recent establishment of the South Asian Wildlife Enforcement Network SAWEN to strengthen regional wildlife enforcement should be an important step forward in this direction India needs to lead this process Once poaching was mainly small local sporadic and for the pot Today it transcends national and international boundaries and like any other mainstream criminal activity is wellorganised wellfunded and ruthless Photograph by Dan Bennett FotercomCC BY The International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime ICCWC comprising the CITES Secretariat INTERPOL the UN Office on Drugs and Crime UNODC the World Bank and the World Customs Organisation WCO is another significant global effort to bring coordinated support to wildlife lawenforcement agencies on the regional and subregional level India must engage proactively and take advantage of such efforts It stands to reason that organised crime needs an organised response We

Rathnavel Pandian Is it fair to criminalise local tribal people for hunting to feed their families Can we afford to lose our rapidly declining biodiversity The author who is the Youth Action CoOrdinator with the Trust for Environment Monitoring and Action Initiating EMAI suggests that greater sensitivity and transparency on the part of wildlife law enforcement officials and a multidisciplinary approach that takes into consideration socioeconomic cultural and ecological imperatives are vital O n an early Monday morning a friend and I went out birding near Sriperumbudur 46 km from Chennai Crossing the Chembarambakkam lake around 625 am we looked up to see a Blackshouldered Kite our first bird of the morning Encouraged we waded deeper into the swamp to discover munias warblers prinias and more Suddenly we heard the unmistakable sound of a gunshot reverberating from the edge of the lake Through our cameras and binoculars we spotted several people moving about furtively and then there it was again a low booming sound of a rifle that dispatched many birds feeding in the shallow crustaceanrich swamp to their end Incensed we made calls to senior birding friends and the Chief Conservator of Forests in the Forest Department and at around 8 am help arrived in the form of two potbellied men astride a rickety TVS 50 bike My friend continued photographing and tracking the poachers as I went out to meet the Forest Department officials wearing civilian clothes Convoluted discussions ensued on which route should be taken to approach the hunters and finally one of the officials decided to walk across the swampy area on foot while the other officer and I took the longer route around the lake through a village over a bumpy mudtrack where the twowheeler finally refused to budge another inch Poaching for the Pot We approached the poachers by pretending to be buyers of exotic bird meat They were local Narikurava tribals and were suspicious of us While some made good their escape four men with some egrets and cormorants in a bag three of them still alive stayed and engaged us in conversation When the official began to take a more than casual interest in the guns they carried the hunters realised they were in trouble One of them initially hesitated to hand over the rifle but was eventually convinced when he understood the consequences of ignoring an officials request At this point all four panicked and fell to our feet proclaiming their innocence stating that they hunted only for food and had no other way to feed their families As we waited for more officials to arrive the pleading turned into silent tears I felt hollow where my heart was supposed to be and a tear rolled down my own face Their haul totalled 41 birds including 19 cormorants a snipe a Common Coot a Purple Swamphen six Whiskered Terns two Purple Herons two Pond Herons four Cattle Egrets and two Little Egrets All this from what is considered a shrinking biodiversity site The Narikurava poachers plead for mercy from potential customers who turned out to be undercover forest officers Soon several officers arrived and congratulated us on our socalled brave feat of capturing the poachers The incident was reported to the nearest magistrate court at Sriperumbudur and the hunters were taken in for questioning Later we were asked to accompany some of the officers to the postmortem proceedings of the 38 dead birds at the Vandalur Zoo Individual reports were typed at a snails pace with constant murmurs among officials to reduce the numbers The officers were unable to identify any of the birds Not one Despite our insistence some of the species were wrongly reported Our respect for the officials hit rock bottom when we were asked not to report the happenings anywhere Why not It was a commendable job wasnt it On returning from the postmortem proceedings we realised that the Narikuravas were to be taken to Vellore jail for a 15day remand aka judicial custody A silent ride back home saw us in deep introspection Who were the Narikuravas Why did they hunt What would have happened if the top official was not notified in the first place What had we done Were the birds more important than these povertystricken people Why did the officers play nice with us How does it all link up Ironically the way I personally perceived poachers the system its flaws accountability and most importantly the big picture was already changing The Narikuravas The Narikuravas claim to have descended from the Khond people of Odisha They are adept at hunting anything from capricious quails to jaunty jackals During the British Raj they hunted using bow and arrows catapults and sometimes the silambams The British introduced them to guns presented so the burra sahebs could be stocked with wild fowl for their tables Some of those rifles are still in use Being nomads they moved from forest to forest but between the Criminal Tribes Act 1871 and the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 their hunting habits came to a legal end and they ended up migrating to cities Here they eked out a living crafting bead necklaces and handmade knickknacks for sale in local markets and on roadsides Some took loans to start scrap metal businesses but these failed and they returned to poaching birds and animals for a living Customers call and ask for specific birds which we deliver to them dead or alive said one of the Narikuravas On some days they undertake ceremonial hunts and consume the meat they obtain The drama that unfolded on September 3 2012 was one such day The haul that was seized from the Narikurava tribals included 41 birds 10 different species Many NGOs have tried to reform the Narikuravas to no avail Some suggest they should be given controlled hunting permits enabling them to make a sustainable living while protecting wildlife But where there is regulation there is corruption The Narikuravas are not even enlisted as Scheduled Tribes which places them below Dalits Saami we were driven out of our forest homes we were driven out of our huts in the cities Where else can we go We are family men Our wives and children need us We hunt to survive In this modern consumerist world where corruption and corporate dominance rule there is little work these people can be offered They are not part of any vote bank either They are at the bottom of the heap marginalised written off as criminals by the Forest Department wildlife experts and conservationists I admit to not having ready answers particularly to those who say that the Narikuravas are now being enlisted to kill elephants and tigers by the illegal wildlife syndicates Frankly they neither need freebies nor taunts They require to have their dignity restored which will only be possible if we find ways to put their knowledge to work to protect what others induce them to harm This much is clear Their knowledge of the forest medicinal plants music and traditions are arcane treasures worth preserving just as carefully as any other cultural heritage of value The Wildlife Enthusiast As a birdwatcher myself the adrenaline that courses through my veins on spotting a bird is something that is better experienced than described For an expert birdwatcher a minute call a quiver of the bushes a faint rustle of leaves is all that is needed to spot and identify an avian Such is the knowledge and passion among this breed of men and women that they barely leave any room for thought for the plight of the evil poachers who upset the balance of the ecosystem by wiping out key species by hunting They dont see why these ecosystems should be disturbed in the name of survival Are there no other ways of earning a livelihood asks an expert bird spotter Their tears and pleadings are just drama They will mint money when they sell their booty Undoubtedly wildlife enthusiasts photographers binocular and scopewielding birders and naturalists have helped countless creatures often by reporting poaching incidents and conducting raids sometimes even risking their lives in encounters in deep forest areas Ditto for the officers and field staff of the various state Forest Departments However while people like us help them arrest a few anonymous poachers the truth is the vast bulk of officials actually cannot even identify leave alone understand what this or that species of bird in the poachers bag means to ecosystems This is not to question wildlife protection at all We need to save what little remains of our wildlife and habitats But something about the system is faulty Its simply not working On conditions of anonymity one official in the know said to us When lower officials get hold of Narikuravas they seldom even report it After seizing all the game weapons and money they coerce the tribals to pay hefty sums of money under the table and then release them Its a vicious cycle Outside the Sriperumbudur magistrate court officials surround the Narikuravas prior to questioning A concerned anticorruption activist and industrialist added that if more people were to flow into cities from villages it would lead to an implosive spiral of doom Slum dwellers and coastal village folk who have become victim to the citys expansion plans are sent to live in tightlypacked camps with little or no work opportunities education facilities and other basic amenities My interest in the issue saw me interact with a friend belonging to a long lineage of privileged hunters In his words If you think you achieved a lot by capturing them heres the deal theyll be eating happily wherever they are and when they come out its back to square one You cannot change them Its their life They are amazing hunters their vision is brilliant But the only compassion they know is for their own kith and kin All meat is food for them Arrest them the way you did and you punish their families not them Instead why not take the issue to a higher level Get media to do indepth reporting Fight hunting per se if you will but dont stop at tokenism My purpose of writing this piece for Sanctuary Asia was a consequence of my realisation that there are no absolutes no rights and wrongs when it comes to survival Having said that I believe that hunting be it for the pot or the wildlife trade must be stopped I was moved at the plight of these beautiful people and felt the urge to communicate their dilemma Hopefully the powers that be in government and out of it will see the wisdom in approaching the problem in ways that solve the problem not merely enable the corrupt or apathetic system to exploit them while the depletion of our wildlife continues apace People like Romulus Whitaker managed to do this with the Irulas who now have welfare cooperatives of their own as have tribal conservancies in the Northeast with collective bargaining power To sweep the Narikuruvas under a symbolic carpet is a sham not a solution The author would like to acknowledge the contribution of Dr Murugavel who heads operations at EMAI for inspiring students such as himself to lead initiatives Note The views expressed in this article are those of the

Srinivasan Nancy Alice Ashwathy Satheesan Nandini Mehrotra and Anand Srinivasan Technology for Wildlife Foundation U ntil July 15 2014 the process for any development project to obtain a green clearance in India involved several stages the circulation of physical project files between different officials at multiple stages of approval File access was limited to the government the applicants seeking green clearances and the authorities granting approvals Moreover the complex nature of clearance processes and the lack of accountability created a lack of trust in the process To remedy this and to ensure better transparency and efficiency in the clearance process the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change MoEFCC has established the PARIVESH website PARIVESH stands for ProActive Responsive facilitation by Interactive and Virtuous Environmental Singlewindow Hub It is a webbased workflow application that has digitised the entire process of submission and monitoring of Environment Forest Wildlife and Coastal Regulation Zone CRZ Clearance proposals submitted by proponents to the Central State and District Level authorities The portal allows project proponents to register themselves and submit applications for various green clearances in digital formats Although seemingly designed for project proponents PARIVESH has become a valuable resource of collated information that is open for viewing by the general public There are currently more than 10000 landuse proposals submitted for clearance at the MoEFCC in India ranging from the construction of multistate national highways to the establishment of smallscale cottage industries Various government officers and committees are assessing the potential impact of these proposed projects before granting approval The Benefits The PARIVESH website hosts an enormous amount of information about all old and new projects seeking green clearances organised by state year category and stage of approval The information comprises spatial data regarding the outlines of the project site location and alignment the area of forest land being diverted site inspection and biodiversity assessment reports Such information is of immense value for conservation and is freely available on the portal Using the appropriate search functions project information concerning any given project is available for viewing or in some cases even downloading The portal also hosts details of discussions of various expert committees through the agenda and meeting minutes allowing people from outside the system to view and analyse the processes that ultimately affect Indias wildlife and environment All the relevant information is presented as an application package with downloadable file attachments which could prove beneficial for conservation research and advocacy The quantity and variety of information on the portal make it a treasure trove for anyone and everyone interested in the green clearance space of India Information that can be found on the PARIVESH website about any development project in India 1 Area sought for clearance 2 Project cost 3 Spatial information about project location in KML Keyhole Markup Language format details of the land required for clearance such as forest division names area of forest and nonforest land village and district wise breakup of the total proposed land etc 4 Details of Project ProponentUser Agency 5 Cost Benefit Analysis undertaken 6 Statuslinks to associated environmental or wildlife clearance if any 7 Project plan feasibility reports site inspection reports Nonuser Friendly Interface While introducing PARIVESH for digitising the green clearance process in India helps to bring about transparency and accountability in the system the portal is not userfriendly and is cumbersome to navigate The system should be able to streamline important projects and allow easy access to relevant information however most of the files are not appropriately tagged making the search options unreliable To be able to find specific projects within a timeframe the user must know specific project details such as the exact name of the project project file number and the clearance level Additionally green clearances are complex processes and involve multiple levels of reviews and recommendations from various government departments These processes are broadly divided into three clearance verticals namely Environmental Clearance Forests Clearance and Wildlife Clearance Each of these verticals has its own set of processes and organisation hierarchies that the project file must circulate through at the level of first the state and then the centre In the instance that a user is able to trace the details of a particular project on the platform comprehending what stage of approval that project could be at and what that stage of approval entails is a task in itself Problems with the PARIVESH website 1 Low Discoverability Navigating through the PARIVESH portal is complicated as information is not organised uniformly across typescategories and sometimes even regarding regions 2 Decision Fatigue Because of the structure of the portal too many steps are involved in obtaining a particular projects information 3 Inappropriate Project Tagging Proposals projects or additional attached documents are not appropriately tagged which makes finding them using the search function cumbersome 4 Complexities of the Clearance Processes The complexities of the clearance processes and organisational hierarchies make access to information additionally difficult The portal does not describe the various stages of approval under different clearances How Can This Be Improved For effective conservation advocacy knowledge of potential areas of intervention is crucial which makes a clear understanding of what happens at each level of approval imperative Simple features such as an option to view projects cumulatively across the clearance types or to view projects on a spatial platform would increase the efficiency of the portal manifold The dashboards for different typesverticals of clearances use abbreviations for the stages of approval with no description of what those abbreviations stand for nor what each of those stages entails thus creating a limitation in the understanding of the clearance procedures altogether Furthermore there is a lack of features that would allow users interested in specific projects to subscribe or receive notifications for any updates on the approvals PARIVESH although perhaps designed for project proponents seeking clearances has been a useful portal for other stakeholders The inclusion of features such as these would revolutionise accessing vast amounts of publicly available data for all stakeholders and will allow them to be more involved To truly achieve the goal of increased transparency and efficiency in the green clearance process in India providing better access to information is key India has a growing population of aware citizens from an array of backgrounds and a better system would greatly empower them to play an active role in determining the future of the environment forests and wildlife of the country Illustration Technology for Wildlife How to Use PARIVESH A stepbystep guide with tips PARIVESH hosts a large volume of project information which is of immense use for awareness campaigning or advocacy However navigating the portal to get to relevant information often involves many steps It is important to narrow down search to the farthest extent possible by applying relevant filters One might also have to scan through multiple project forms and verify information from other media articles and web reports However if a project is cleared it is mandatory for it to have gone through PARIVESH and information about it must be available on the portal Heres how to access this information Step 1 Make a list of all the known information about the project one is seeking information on For example let us do so for the Etalin Hydropower Project Critical known information about Etalin hydropower project State name Arunachal Pradesh Area Dibang Valley Project Proponent Jindal Power Ltd Category of Project Hydroelectrichydel Date proposed Before 2016 although not crucial it is often helpful to review other existing informationmedia reports about the project of interest Information such as the timeline of the project helps in narrowing down search Step 2 Explore PARIVESH Portal Note All projects proposed on PARIVESH are organised according to the type of clearance sought into three categories environment forest and wildlife clearance To find information each of these types can be explored independently The following sections provide a step by step guide to navigating the portal For Forest Clearance 1 Open httpspariveshnicin homepage scroll down and select Forest Clearance 2 To view all forest clearance projects select Dashboard option on the header 3 Once clicked dashboard apply filters to narrow down search filters such as state category and hit search Note Projects under forest clearance on PARIVESH are organised in two categories Stage I and Stage II If the status of clearance of the project is known lead search by that status However if this information is not known explore both stages 4 To view all Stage 1 projects click on the Form A part II Under Stage I button on the dashboard As seen below there are a total of 12 hydel projects proposed in Arunachal Pradesh which are currently under stage 1 5 Click on ACCEPTED these are all the relevant projects according to the applied filters 6 A dataset of all projects as per the chosen category will be displayed with unique project IDs and other relevant information which should allow one to review and identify the project of interest Things to note while trying to identify project of interest i Is the project proponent the same as known information Eg Jindal Power Ltd ii Is the forest divisionarea the same as known information Eg Dibang Valley iii Is the project proposed in the known timeline Eg 2015 Screen grab of all hydel projects in Arunachal as on May 5 2022 7 Each project has a corresponding form which hosts information about the project To view this information and to recognise project of interest click on magnifying glass icon under column titled View Report on Allocation of Fresh Forest Land FormA PartI 8 The Form A part I includes information such as the forest division details area for clearance spatial data additional documents etc all in downloadable formats 9 All the documents and the form itself can be downloaded as PDFs It is important to note that until the project is granted final clearance the proponents can make edits add or delete files on the portal Technology for Wildlife Foundation s mission is to amplify conservation impact through the use of appropriate

like a bank account for us Thats where the tigers live and multiply The bank is secured from all sides but when there are too many tigers in an area one or two will stray trying to establish a new territory Thats all we need Then we can make a withdrawal Who cares whether the tiger is old or young for us it is the length of its skin and the weight of its bones that matters It was about 12 years ago that I received this unforgettable lesson over a shared drink and the drag of a beedi on the sustainability of tiger hunting as a livelihood It was the first time that I had met a pedigreed tiger poacher He was from the Bawaria community I was undercover with an informer trying to strike a deal for some tiger parts I was scared I remember that well Some years later I spent a few months embedded with a group of suspected nomadic tiger hunters I moved about with them dressed as they were sharing their booze travelling without a ticket in trains And there were more lessons to be learned among them the fact that when it comes to the tracking and hunting of tigers the skill of these traditional tiger poachers is unmatchable A Pardhi or Bawaria call him Bhima Kheru Kuttu whatever can stalk a tiger in its own territory walking the same paths it walks armed with nothing but a crude knife affixed to a bamboo pole outsmarting forest guards and modern surveillance methods

jungles of India They once served as hunting assistants to the maharajas and later the British big game hunters They drove tigers and other game towards their masters who sat around on their elephants or on their machaans doing nothing in the hunt other than aiming a rifle and pulling the trigger and of course striking a grand pose with their dead prey The British later listed them as Denotified Tribes largely because of their involvement in robberies and dacoities with the victim often ending up murdered The hunters thus became the hunted and the communities became increasingly marginalised Today they live a seminomadic life they have their settlements in places like Katni Kalka and Badhi and are involved in a number of livelihoods some of them illegal A Wildlife Trust of India WTI team interviewed a number of Pardhis in Mumbai as part of a study conducted two years ago Some were found eking out an existence by peddling fake Ayurvedic medicines others sold cheap toys at traffic signals Some of the women were involved in prostitution There was little dignity for them in that life In the interiors of Maharasthra some have now taken to the manufacture of illicit liquor for instance a settlement about 50 km from Nagpur supplies country liquor to vendors in the city When they arent doing any of this they hunt And in hunting they take pride Their formidable success as hunters in fact rests on this shared sense of pride and the bedrock of their community bond When a Pardhi or Bawaria is arrested by enforcement officials he can be rest assured that the community will take care of his family and he will receive all the necessary support in securing bail and fighting cases in court On the flip side their closeknit nature is also a bulwark against betrayal which brings with it the promise of bloodshed or at the very least total ostracisation by the tribe Hunting areas are divided up between gangs around Diwali Review meetings are sometimes conducted around Holi these guys are true professionals Gangs move back to their native areas during the offseasons and regroup in villages on the forest fringes to hunt in winter and summer Stealth is one of their biggest assets in the field unless you know the hunters by face you wont ever actually notice them They do not engage in any other criminal activities when a hunt is being planned They carry documentation and identity proofs often carefully acquired fakes that can pass the basic scrutiny of frontline enforcement officials For all intents and purposes they are a peaceful bunch of nomadic gypsies living out of a couple of tents their children begging on public transport or on the streets their women selling plastic flowers or plasterofparis idols of gods and goddesses by the roadside Recently as their camps have come under increased scrutiny they have taken to using local temple grounds where they get free food and shelter The actual hunters often arrive a few days after other community members have established themselves having waited to hear of any trouble Their hunting implements are secreted well away from the place they are residing usually in the filthiest of spots to avoid possible discovery Once they settle in they conduct scouting trips to determine the movement of forest guards and find the best places to penetrate the forest They target the fringes of Protected Areas which do not have much active protection Several years ago during one of my learning and training trips in the field I spent a few weeks with one of WTIs contacts from the Pardhi clan in a village situated in a tiger corridor In the evenings we would go out for a walk smoking beedis wrapped in cheap woollen blankets listening for alarm calls from the forest When he heard an alarm call especially that of a chital my Pardhi friend would freeze up train his ears towards the sound and declare after a few minutes the distance of the call and the direction of movement of the predator that had caused it We would walk the next morning to the riverbed that bordered the forest and sure enough find pugmarks where he had predicted they would be Dressed as we were like daily wage labourers no one would have suspected us had we been potential hunters There was no one around in fact to ask us what business we had near the forest Professional tribal tiger hunters display the traditional tools of their trade Members of these communities have been hunting in Indias jungles for hundreds of years Photo Nagaraj HN The Jaws of Death Have you ever been attacked by a tiger Ive asked this question to many suspected hunters I have encountered and I still rememberJale Singhs answer We know we are in dangerous territory in the forest But I began going to the forest when I was a teenager since then I have walked and stalked wildlife across many forests but never had a lifethreatening encounter We avoid elephants and snakes as much as we can they are far more dangerous than tigers and leopards Jale Singh a Bawaria served a threeyear jail sentence in Karnataka Hes been a free man for two years now probably doing even as you read this what he knows best The Pardhis and Bawarias are like trained guerilla warriors in the forest And they have a snipers patience They spend a few days watching their target visiting waterholes scratching and scent marking its territory They intuitively use pug impression pads which our trained biologists do to estimate a tigers size or determine the time at which it has passed a particular spot When they are ready they set their trap The jaw trap or khadka used over centuries is the signatory equipment of professional tiger hunters from the Pardhi or Bawaria gangs They dont use poison or guns they trust their simple khadkas They know that a tiger has virtually no chance of escape once those deadly jaws have snapped shut The traps precise positioning is usually left to the most experienced hunter in the group Once in my trap a tiger becomes a mouse one such Pardhi master hunter from Sehore Madhya Pradesh proclaimed to me once He knows there is no escape At times we dont have to do anything just stand at a safe distance and watch him die from increased blood pressure and a heart attack Otherwise we club the tiger to death or use a spear fixed on a fourfoot stick to spear it in its mouth this helps to silence it quickly and the skin remains undamaged It takes just half an hour to kill a tiger this way Skinning it takes less than two hours The deskinned carcass is hidden in a nearby ditch and the bones the most valuable items are collected weeks or even months later after the body has sufficiently decomposed The hunters remove the trap leaving the secured chain buried in the ground for the next trip They conceal the trap in a preselected location and slip out of the forest with the skin Only the dead tiger knows they were there Once out of the forest the skin is moved towards the IndoNepal border Middlemen now collect it and smuggle it across the border The poacher travels back to his village with his gang His share of the money is homedelivered to him or he collects it en route Fifteen days of work in the field should fetch him enough money to survive for a good six months where he will do nothing but drink smoke eat well satisfy other biological needs and relax When his cash reserves run low the trade will be there ready with the initial capital to fund the next trip And so the cycle will continue Very few hunters ever become rich despite being involved in a highprofit profession They dont save money or invest well They remain poor and nomadic hunters while the traders who control their lives the Sansar Chands make the big bucks without ever setting foot in a forest A tiger killed by a jaw trap in the TadobaAndhari Tiger Reserve Maharashtra The Pardhis and Bawarias prefer the use of jaw traps or khadkas to trap tigers over poison or guns Photo Bandu Dhotre A Matter of Conflict Not many established gangs of Pardhis and Bawarias operate across the country today thanks mainly to the concerted efforts of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau WCCB and the Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra Forest Departments with the support of the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force That the operations conducted by these organisations have been successful is down to the commitment of a few individuals who have meticulously followed leads worked with informants and analysed and sifted through every piece of intel they have received from various sources Arrests of suspects involved in the trade the recovery of traps and tiger products is all good says one of the WCCB investigators WTI has worked with closely Where we miss out most however is ensuring a good rate of convictions in trial court cases If these people remain in jail for a few years that will have a greater impact on their networks and activities As it is many of them get bail They need money to pay their lawyers to keep them out on bail So they do what they know best hunt another tiger to cover their legal costs Another issue is the way conflict is increasing in our forest fringes and wildlife corridor areas he continues With cattle and human beings being killed by tigers tolerance levels are going down People poison tigers as they dont want to live in fear of an attack the day is not far when they will even pay these tiger hunters to kill tigers Suspected poachers with a seized tiger skin Beyond arrests and seizures it is an improved rate of convictions in trial courts that will really help break the illegal wildlife trade chain Photo Jose LouiesWTI So as Indias tiger numbers continue to grow celebration must be tempered with scepticism for with the degradation and fragmentation of our forests tigers are increasingly being forced to adopt migrant lifestyles constantly moving between Protected Areas sharing their territories with villages and farmlands and everyone residing therein And camped there on the fringes ever ready to make a withdrawal from the bank stands a Bhima or a Kheru or a Luchi or a Baro jaw trap ready watching stalking waiting for an opportune moment All that

Mithawala N owhere but in India can the biggame hunter get so much for his money says the narrator of the documentary film Tiger Shikar in India made in the mid1900s The camera follows a group of armed white men on elephant back their pursuit of a tiger being guided by a local shikari As the shikari blows his whistle and shouts the instruction jao jao the beaters start flushing the tiger out of the thicket with sticks and stones unsettling all creatures of the forest The tiger annoyed finally comes out growling The moment it comes in full view of the hunters two rounds are fired at it The majestic predator falls on the ground shrouded in smoke After two more rounds the tiger lies almost lifeless The mahout prods the reluctant elephant that gingerly lifts its leg to trample the tiger Indias wildlife has endured persecution over hundreds of years Before the British were the Mughals Akbars legacy of bloodlust for big game was carried forward by his successors history is replete with accounts of their hunting expeditions until the end of the dynasty Tigers leopards or sloth bears all were fair quarry for princes and sahibs alike till hunting was finally outlawed by the Indian government in 1972 Over 80000 tigers more than 150000 leopards and 200000 wolves were slaughtered in the fifty years from 1875 to 1925 writes historian Mahesh Rangarajan in his book Indias Wildlife History An Introduction Trophy hunting has now been replaced by poaching fuelled by the insatiable demand for animal parts from the Asian luxury and medicine markets Looking at the demand for body parts of just one species the tiger helps uncover the scale of the problem From its bile blood bones and brain to its eyeballs penis and whiskers the list is longer almost every part of the tiger is mistakenly believed to be a cure for disorders ranging from serious to mundane and even bizarre arthritis malaria rabies laziness pimples evil spirits and fever caused by ghosts Wildlife Crime on the Rise India lost more tigers to poaching in 2016 than any year since 2001 According to data on poaching cases compiled by the Wildlife Protection Society of India WPSI we have lost 1147 tigers in the last 24 years an average of 47 tigers each year But this is likely to be a fraction of the actual number WPSIs website suggests that Customs authorities multiply detected offences by 10 to estimate the size of an illegal trade Various kinds of traps hunting tools and skinning knives seized during raids conducted by the Wildlife Crime Cell of the Melghat Tiger Reserve while investigating a tiger poaching case in 2013 Photo courtesy Vishal Bansod WCT Poaching and other wildlife crimes increased by 52 per cent between 2014 and 2016 states a report titled State of Indias Environment 2017 In Figures published by the nonprofit Centre for Science and Environment More species are now under threat from poaching and illegal trade than ever before the number of species has gone up from 400 in 2014 to 465 in 2016 Another disturbing trend also reported in Sanctuary Vol 28 No 2 April 2008 is of the Internet facilitating illegal wildlife trade In July 2016 the MoEFCC listed 106 websites that were advertising the sale of rare animals and their parts The list included Amazon Snapdeal Ebay Quikr and even YouTube Abysmal Conviction Rates Conviction rates in wildlife crime cases are abysmally low across India If one looks at Maharashtra the conviction rate stood at a dismal 1156 per cent according to media reports in 2015 A review of judgments delivered in six years showed that of the 147 court orders under the Wild Life Protection Act 1972 WPA only 17 had recorded convictions These figures throw light on the lacunae in the investigation documentation and prosecution and explain why law has little deterrence value when it comes to wildlife crime According to data analysed by an independent agency the conviction rate for cases relating to Schedule I animals is barely one per cent in Maharashtra This is predominantly because the accused are casually let off on bail Once out they tamper with evidences and witnesses making it difficult for the prosecution to establish a clear case of conviction says wildlife lawyer Kartik Shukul who currently serves as special counsel for the Forest Departments of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh There is an urgent need to increase the quantum of punishment for wildlife crimes For a firsttime conviction in a case involving a Schedule I animal the quantum of punishment is only three to seven years Because the quantum is so low it is considered a very trivial offence by the judiciary he says To improve the rate of convictions in India it is imperative that this be changed as has already been done in Assam where it has been increased to life imprisonment in case of a second conviction All other states which either have Schedule I animals or are facing the problem of rampant poaching need to change the quantum from seven years to at least life if not more Also the quantum of punishment should not be the sole yardstick on the basis of which the seriousness of the offence is decided the same must be established by the consequences of the offence and its ramifications on the society at large Tightening the Conviction Noose On its part the Wildlife Conservation Trust WCT has adopted a practical approach to tackle the problem of poor conviction rates Its Wildlife Law Enforcement Training WLET team has been training frontline forest staff in law enforcement since 2012 So far 180 training sessions have been held for 11500 forest guards across 30 Protected Areas PAs in nine states and 15 forest training institutes Since 2017 forest staff have also been receiving training in evidence collection site security and the application of forensics to build watertight cases The trainings are focused at addressing the lacunae in current enforcement responses to wildlife crime that contribute significantly to poor conviction rates across India These include weak implementation of the existing provisions of the WPA poor evidence collection practices improper crime scene processing methodologies and insufficient or improper legal case documentation The trainings are a mix of classroom and field sessions The latter involve activities in which teams process different crime scenarios collect evidences and make presentations after preparing casework Choosing the Right Noose To build a strong case forest staff must apply the right sections and provisions of the WPA The old approach was to apply as many sections as possible and hope that the accused will be found guilty of violating at least one says Kiran Rahalkar the lead trainer in WCTs WLET team If the forest officer charges the accused of violating four sections out of which heshe is acquitted in three the benefit of doubt swings in favour of the accused To prevent this we teach them precise and sharp application of sections to reduce the possibility of acquittal Sanjay Thakur from WCTs WLET team demonstrates techniques for recording pugmarks during a field session on identifying tracks and signs of wild animals at the Pench Tiger Reserve Maharashtra Photo courtesy Samyukta WCT An old practice still prevalent in Forest Departments is to apply Section 9 of the WPA which deals with the prohibition of hunting in every case of wildlife crime Sometimes it becomes difficult to build a case on that charge and proving it becomes even more difficult in the absence of the linked evidence adds Sanjay Thakur an integral part of WCTs WLET team We make forest guards familiar with other strong sections that attract the same quantum of punishment and are easier to prove Forensics The Missing Link Humko saari khabar mil jaati hain hum sahi aadmi ko pakad bhi lete hain says a forest guard during an interactive training session indicating that their information network almost always helps them nab the perpetrator of the crime He then goes on to explain the real challenge establishing links between the criminal and the crime in the court of law To plug this gap WCT trains forest guards in forensically sound processes of evidence collection and preservation Wildlife crime usually occurs in places where access to eyewitness testimony is rare Hence its important that forest staff increasingly rely on scientific evidence rather than eyewitnesses that frequently turn hostile explains C Samyukta the forensics trainer at WCT WCTs forensics trainer Samyukta introducing forest guards to the basic theoretical principles of forensics Photo courtesy Sanjay Thakur WCT Clearly wildlife crime has evolved over the years and spears and bullets have been to a considerable extent replaced by silent killing mechanisms like poisoning and electrocution Its important to establish the fact that the crime was intentional and not a mere accident In proving that a crime has been committed and linking the criminal with the methods and tools used and the scene of the crime scientific evidence plays a crucial part she says In lessons learnt the hard way poor evidence collection practices by forest guards have helped the accused evade convictions If an animal has died of poisoning its important that the forest staff collect a body organ or tissue that would exhibit the poison Similarly it is important for the forest staff to understand the effect that different hunting methods have on animals Equally important is to know what kind of clues and traces criminals are likely to leave behind in the process of hunting she says Guards learn these finer aspects of forensics during WCTs classroom sessions as well as mock crime scene exercises wherein they process a crime scene and collect and seal evidences using tools that are part of the evidence collection kit see Using Forensics to Tackle Wildlife Crime below distributed during the training Photo courtesy Rizwan Mithawala WCT Law enforcement training is an indispensable cog in WCTs 360 approach to conservation As we chart new frontiers to tackle the everevolving threats to Indias wildlife and ecosystems the tiger burns bright in our hearts For the tiger is not just one species it is the indicator of the health of our forests For forests are not just pretty places being biodiversity vaults they are our insurance against climate change and food and water scarcity Using Forensics to Tackle Wildlife Crime During the wildlife law enforcement training WCT distributes forensic evidence collection kits to forest guards The purpose of the kit is to ensure that all evidence is collected and preserved complying with robust forensic standards so the most can be got out of it through laboratory analysis To meet this purpose the kit contains 18 essential items Two pairs of disposable easy to replace gloves help preserve the integrity of the evidence A magnifying glass helps guards detect and observe microscopic traces of evidence While spatulas and forceps aid in collection of solid samples droppers help in collecting liquid samples like water from a poisoned waterhole Apart from cotton swabs and filter paper as an aid to collect blood from a crime scene the kit also contains a glass vial to collect and preserve biological samples like meat Packets of silica gel ensure preservation of the samples and aid in preventing spoilage of biological evidence While ziplock bags brown paper envelopes brown packaging tape and a permanent marker come in handy to package and secure the evidence at the crime scene itself sealing wax can be used to seal the evidence once it reaches the forest department office Forest staff are also required to prepare a rough sketch nazari naqsha of the crime scene To prevent guesswork in measurements the kit also contains a measuring tape Photo courtesy Rizwan Mithawala Among all Tiger Range Countries TRCs India recorded the greatest number of seizures 355 and a minimum

improved technology and a much greater appetite among the young for books to remind them of the wonderful biosphere in which they live it is heartening to see how many new highquality publications are emerging from within India Here are three books that Sanctuary believes should be in every public library and in the homes of all those whose hearts beat to natures drum The Great Nicobar Betrayal Curated by Pankaj Sekhsaria Published by Frontline Paperback 100 pages Rs 499 When over a million trees in an untouched rainforest ecosystem could be bulldozed when an island and its people and biodiversity could be caused irreparable harm you understand the urgency to talk about it and prevent it even if it is a compilation of your own work Such is the case of this book The Great Nicobar Betrayal a selection of articles published in Sanctuary Asia Frontline The Wire and The Leaflet about the follies of the plan laughably dubbed Holistic Development of Great Nicobar Island Last year the faint stirrings from the Bay of Bengal quickly turned into an entire volume dedicated to the immense biological heritage of the island and the alarming changes it was set to face owing to the development plan that is now moving forward at great speed The articles from the April 2023 issue of Sanctuary Asia along with contributions from other proficient authors comprise this timely book curated by Pankaj Sekhsaria Despite the projects staggering cost of Rs 72000 crore information about it remains scattered and the immensity of the plan and its impact is impossible to gauge without the pieces compiled in the book The chapters take the reader through the projects history ecological concerns tribal issues and the legal angle giving a comprehensive overview of the situation Sekhsaria who has lived in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and authored two books on the Union Territory contributes two pieces one on the details of the project and another focussing on the political involvement in it The article on the National Green Tribunals stand critically examines the green courts disappointing position on the project The piece on risk assessment details the threats of seismic activity to the project Degrees of insularity paints a picture of the Indigenous people and their intricate connection with the land The book also includes pieces on the islands flora and fauna a birders experiences and profiles of its two Indigenous communities The annexures include important letters sent to the authorities a representation of the widespread objection to the project The book is useful for students policy makers planners politicians and for anyone who cares about our planet Often writers researchers and experts share their findings with the world to prove the social and environmental damage caused by a project often at great personal risk to their lives hoping that the planet is protected justice is upheld and our future generations are cared for Such

to access our issues for free ok Photo Mudasir Manzoor Previous Next In Joannas Footsteps First published in Sanctuary Asia Vol 40 No 8 August 2020 By Mudasir Manzoor I t is impossible to describe the atmosphere when a hangul stag calls loudly in the wilds of Dachigam and it reverberates through the valley The hangul is a rare animal and it calls rarely too My patience passion and love for the wild has led me into the depths of Kashmirs Dachigam National Park in pursuit of this vanishing deer My interest in the hangul was sparked by the work of Joanna Van Gruisen A wildlife photographer writer and conservationist originally from the UK she has spent over three decades living in the subcontinent including many months exploring the deep jungles and broad valleys of Dachigam I move across the same trails that she once roamed freely Gratnar Trajtekar Leych valley Gugiyar Gaglari Sangerguloo valley Nagbern valley Dagwan valley Hoksar Hangalmarg Burzwas valley Marsar pastures as well as the plains of lower Dachigam Once widely distributed across the mountains of Kashmir and into the Chamba district of neighbouring Himachal Pradesh the hangul is today restricted to a small population in the Dachigam National Park some 15 km from Srinagar city First identified by Alfred Wagner in 1844 the species is believed to have travelled all the way from Bukhara in Central Asia to Kashmir It is considered the only subspecies of red deer in the subcontinent It is similar in appearance to the European red deer but its coat is dark grey and dark brown not red The hangul has a tiny white rump patch and a short dark tail At the end of spring hangul deer shed their antlers and make their way above the forest line They return to these lower pastures only in autumn once their antlers have regrown Now the rutting commences and through September and October the handsome stags fight for dominance and to establish their harem of does They show off their impressive headgear and their calls echo across the valley In the past Kashmir attracted the attentions of explorers hunters sportsman royals and locals all lured by the rich game in the valley The rapacious appetite of these hunters took a heavy toll on mountain ungulates decimating populations of the hangul markhor and ibex amongst others The hangul was a prized catch and a preparation of its meat was considered a delicacy by Kashmiri folk In the book The Valley of Kashmir author Walter R Lawrence writes that before 1890 hangul were so common that during winters when snow shrouded the mountains and forests hangul would approach nearby villages in search of food but were often killed when they did Even Dachigam the last bastion of this noble species was originally created by Maharaja Hari Singh as a game park for his guests In 1910 he relocated ten villages from the valleys and mountains near Srinagar thus creating Dachigam Rakh quite literally the reserve of ten villages In 1947 Dachigam Rakh was handed over to the Directorate of Game and Fisheries At that time it is believed that the population of Hangul was between 1000 to 2000 individuals in Dachigam but the first count done by legendary naturalist EP Gee showed that just 400 individuals survived here In 1951 Dachigam was declared a Wildlife Sanctuary and in 1981 it was upgraded to a National Park At this point the park was handed over to the newly created Wildlife Protection Department but the damage had already been done Fewer than 250 hangul were left in Dachigam The parks more recent history is just as tumultuous In the 90s with the rise in armed conflict wildlife protection became near impossible Forests were cleared animals poached and forest guards killed Simultaneously nomadic shepherds entered the Protected Area in search of pasture for their wards and occupied the most lush meadows The healthy upper pastures where hangul used to spend the summers were taken over by domestic livestock that outcompeted the deer Till date the upper areas of Dachigam are overrun by thousands of sheep goats horses and cattle Thankfully the wellprotected Dagwan and Namblan valleys provide some succour for the hangul The ravenous livestock are not the only problem for this endemic deer The nomadic herders at Khatpathri are of the opinion that their sheep dogs drastically hinder the movement of wildlife too But all is not lost There have been encouraging sightings of hangul herds by trekkers in these areas In May 2017 one group sighted six deers crossing the Burzwas pasture adjoining the Dagwan valley And in 2018 while coming from Dagwan valley at Waskhar I sighted and photographed a tenpointer male hangul It was a huge relief for me to see this majestic animal in upper Dachigam where most consider it long gone Having glimpsed the deer in these higher reaches of Dachigam I was spurred to explore other neighbouring valleys In remote Namblan I found indirect evidence of their presence and met a nomad who told me that in 2016 a female hangul and her fawn would come to lick the salt he provided to his flock He also said that a brown bear would regularly be seen in the area but it was shot dead ner Marsar lake and none have been spotted here since In 2018 through hardwork and a miracle two female hanguls were captured and fitted with satellite collars by the Department of Wildlife Protection The females traversed the old migratory summer grazing corridor in Gurez valley of northern Kashmir the historical summer pastures of the hangul One of the collared individuals moved outside Dachigam towards Surfrao Akhal and Kangan blocks of Sindh Reserve Forest The hangul crossed the mighty Sindh rivulet and a national highway to move further ahead but its movements were restricted from Yechihama onwards possibly due to heavy human and livestock grazing disturbances Its adventures proved to us that these ancient corridors can still be revived The last census in 2019 pinned the hangul population at about 150 individuals I hope peace will return to our valley and its wildlife so that the hangul can return to its alpine pastures and roam freely once again Mudasir Manzoor is a young wildlife conservationist from Kashmir He aims to place camera traps in upper Dachigam to document the biodiversity of these pastures and lay the foundation for future conservation efforts join the conversation subscribe Kids

Minister of India Narendra Modi planted a sapling at his residence at 7 Race Course Road New Delhi June 5 2016 will no doubt see more photoops more calls to action more celebrities planting trees All understandable The same time last year Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said Many of the Earths ecosystems are nearing tipping points of depletion or irreversible change He was right But since then very little the government has done has been right Worse in the wholly mistaken belief that India must get rich to feed and clothe its people and then look to improve our ecological circumstances our government is purposefully pushing us quicker towards the tipping point from which there may well be no return for the 13 billion people of the Indian subcontinent It is this get rich fast then repair the ecological damage done later that spurs the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change MoEFCC to grant environmental clearances without sufficient due diligence Of course only the advice of those who endorse the ecolethal plans that take a toll of forests lakes wetlands coasts corals islands and even deserts is ever placed on record The list of ecological misdemeanors is by now legend with even the business press alarmed at the cavalier way in which Indias natural health is being sacrificed What follows is a smattering of examples which should be treated as a mere indication of the deeper malaise that has percolated down to virtually every state city municipality and even gram sabha Tragically in this era of climate change raiding the commons has become the norm River linking Its a hypnotic idea An intuitive one Where water is scarce why not transport it from an area where water is in plenty But there is a glitch Transporting water cannot be done without creating reservoirs and canals India has an astounding number of both virtually all underperforming Virtually all unable to perform the impossible task of achieving the contradictory ambitions of irrigation power generation and flood control Worse drowning forests kills water sources and sends carbon into the atmosphere thus aggravating the water security problem The river linking idea was first mooted by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2008 and is being pushed by our current government despite a retinue of experts stating unambiguously that engineering interventions seeking to shift water from the Brahmaputra and lower Ganges basin to waterscarce regions in western and central India through the construction of reservoirs dams and canals is quite literally a pipedream Changing the natural flow of rivers will inevitably cause waterlogging in areas that never previously faced any such issues Reservoirs will inevitably silt up Fish breeding grounds will die Downstream impacts including daily flooding in say Kaziranga and other such riverine areas is a given This will make it impossible for all manner of wildlife to adapt Lets take the case of the KenBetwa river linking project Estimated to cost Rs 10000crores it aims to link the Ken river in Madhya Pradesh to the Betwa river in Uttar Pradesh Officially it will require the diversion of 5258 ha of forest land including 4141 ha of the Panna Tiger Reserve The idea is to channel the Ken river westwards against its natural flow To begin with the forest destruction will be far greater than the submergence Besides the project will probably destroy more than just the tiger highly endangered vultures for instance Vultures nest on cliff ledges and tall trees With blasting and digging and tree felling both are likely to be damaged A barrage near the gharial sanctuary will not just harm plans to repopulate the rivers crocodilians but also impact aquatic fauna including the mahseer fish and mugger The damage to riverine ground nesting birds and other aquatic fauna will never ever be fully documented leave alone understood The Honorable Minister for Environment and Forest Prakash Javadekar has already cleared PhaseI of the KenBetwa river linking project The fait accompli is sought to be justified on the grounds that the irrigation project will help the droughtaffected areas of Bundelkhand Even a cursory examination of ground realities confirms that this miracle is wellnigh impossible The National Board for Wildlife NBWL now populated by either complicit or overmild members has said the damage to Panna will be compensated Not a word about the irreparable damage to tiger corridors towards the southwest or the total blockage by the reservoir itself By some estimates the larger river linking project will cost more displace more humans and destroy more forests and other ecological assets than Chinas infamous Three Gorges project that is acknowledged to have been a failure almost before it started Options Well one would be to make existing moribund hydroelectric and water storage projects actually deliver some of the benefits they promised This might involve improving catchment forests retrofitting turbines dramatically reducing transmission losses and investing in efficiency up and down the chain from power producers to consumers Equally important would be to absorb the wisdom of generating power in a decentralised way because it is after all consumed in a decentralised way across India in the villages that are used as figleafs behind which large corporations justify mining damming and otherwise destabilising Indias ecological foundations Equally effective would be communitybased solutions to restore our water security by reviving traditional water structures and encouraging urban rainwater harvesting programmes Naturally this must be coupled with correcting our cropping patterns to bring them in line with agroclimatic imperatives Waterintensive crops such as sugarcane in droughtprone areas are not in the national interest Mining India has the third largest coal reserves in the world and roughly 70 per cent of Indias electricity needs are met by coalfired thermal power The governments support for more coal mines continues to be a major threat to our forests especially in central and eastern India Earlier governments allotted coal blocks arbitrarily often illegally between 1993 and 2008 These allotments were subsequently cancelled by the Supreme Court The current government has changed the licensing procedure from allocations to auctions or competitive bidding and passed the Coal Mines Special Provisions Act 2015 allowing private firms to mine and sell coal commercially Over the last year several coal blocks have thus been auctioned bringing in a promise of revenue in future years for coalrich states Without applying its mind to its real brief protecting the environment the MoEFCC has issued memo after memo allowing coal mines to expand capacity without further clearances or even public hearings Ashish Fernandes Senior Campaigner Greenpeace says Existing and proposed coal mines threaten tiger corridors in a large swathe of central India connecting famous reserves such as Tadoba Kanha Achanakmar and Bandhavgarh Elephant habitats in Odisha and Chhattisgarh are being lost to expanding coal mines as well Renewable energy is now as cheap as coal power India and the planet are faced with crippling climate change impacts drought and related forest fires floods and crop failure on an unprecedented scale How can the government continue to justify destroying our last remaining forests for more coal which will only exacerbate the climate problem Linear Projects and more Power lines fourlane highways canals and railway lines that run through Protected Areas not only cause wildlife roadkills but impede free movement affect home ranges isolate wildlife populations and hamper genetic diversity What with ribbon development and increased human presence directly or indirectly new roads in wilderness areas add to deforestation and ecosystem woes The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority has for instance earmarked prime wetlands home to Sarus Cranes to build homes The planets wetlands not only help mitigate floods and droughts they also recharge aquifers and store roughly as much carbon as is currently present in our overloaded atmosphere While laying the foundation stone for the NH7 fourlaning project that passes through the KanhaPench corridor Sanctuary Vol XXXV No 6 June 2015 the government proudly proclaimed that their policy to clear all projects involving linear development including railways roads irrigation canals transmission lines and more were in the national interest We beg to differ There was an alternate alignment for NH7 through Chhindwara which would have kept the critical PenchKanha corridor intact and PenchMansinghdeo and the NavegaonNagzira Tiger Reserves safe from harm But they did not choose this The Wildlife Institute of India under pressure virtually pleaded for a combination of over and underpasses to mitigate the snapped corridors Their original recommendation involved 10 underpasses 55 km all together each seven metres high The National Highways Authority of India NHAI objected They said the cost was prohibitive and therefore the number of underpasses was arbitrarily reduced to nine and the length to a wholly inadequate 27 km What is more conservation biologists were trumped when the height of the passages was reduced to 45 m According to the latest reports the length has been further reduced to 22 km No scientific explanations were forthcoming The Vishnuprayag Hydroelectric Project in Uttarakhand completely failed to meet its extravagant promise of controlling floods on the Alaknanda river The colossal loss of life and property seems to have taught India no lessons whatsoever Photo Courtesywwwmatugangablogspotin Hydroelectric Projects Despite the global and Indian thrust on renewable sources of energy like solar wind and micro hydro large scale hydropower continues to enamour our planners Within just three months of being elected into power Prime Minister Modi laid foundation stones for the 600 megawatt Kholongchu Hydel Power Project in Bhutan a nation that prides itself on its forests and biodiversity Later he visited Nepal and offered to finance the construction of two transmission lines and a massive 6480 MW Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project on the Mahakali river Back home in Arunachal Pradesh the construction of the massive 3000 megawatt Dibang Power Project was approved reversing the earlier official decision not to clear it ignoring the concerns of forest officials biodiversity experts communities seismic and climate change threats Local communities are up in arms and are opposing the ruthless destruction of their biodiversity and their very way of life as also exemplified by the continued stoppage of work on the 2000 MW Subansiri Lower HEP for over five years now In Tawang district the National Green Tribunal suspended the environmental clearance and an agitated prodam lobby conspired to kill the movement against destructive hydropower projects there leading to the death of two Buddhist Lama activists As many as 200 large hydropower projects are planned for the Himalaya in Northeast India in addition to a similar number in northern Indian states of Uttarakhand Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir The crippling damage caused by the Vishnuprayag dam in Uttarakhand during the flood disaster of June 2013 seems to have taught the government no lessons The biodiversityrich and earthquakeprone Northeast is probably one of the worlds most dangerous zones for hydropower dams irrespective of the lobbying of drooling contractors and their supportive planners Not only will killer floods take place as they do with increasing frequency and intensity the slopes destabilised by deforestation roads colonies quarrying and mining will fill reservoirs with silt As always enthusiastic planners turn a blind eye to reality The Maheshwar dam across the Narmada river in Madhya Pradesh has been halfbuilt but there is no money left to rehabilitate the residents of 60 villages displaced by the dam even as those displaced by the Sardar Sarovar Dam continue to fight in the Courts and outside Some have already started drifting into city slums Others are forced to aggravate deforestation of the very slopes that feed water into the dams Hunting Wildlife as Vermin India imbibed a bad and grossly faulted habit from the British who labeled wild dogs or dholes as vermin because they competed for the same prey as tigers which the landed wanted alive so they could kill them instead Today with rampant humanwildlife conflict raging through the length and breadth of India the Central Government is encouraging State Governments to declare cropraiding wild herbivores as vermin While these animals do cause crop damage the fact is that exterminating the natural prey of large carnivores is without question going to aggravate humananimal conflict when the hungry cats turn to livestock or worse Turning to selfappointed shikaris many of whom proudly relive the days of the Raj through images posted on Facebook and Twitter politicians offer a carte blanche to such hunters unmindful of scientific advice and common sense Particularly in buffer areas and corridors that surround forests such as Tadoba the scale of humananimal conflict is going to rise dramatically as wild ungulate populations are depleted Predictably poaching syndicates will collude with hardpressed locals to poison waterholes lay snares and pass on information that helps the nefarious networks to flourish What Really Matters The MoEFCC claims that projects worth thousands of crores with an employment potential of over one million people had been held up against the national interest The transparent purpose of the claim of course was to quickly clear projects often economically suicidal projects such as high dams in the Himalaya without the inconvenience of due diligence Ignoring hard climate change realities that suggest that the only reliable way to shore up Indias water security is to reforest the subcontinent unblock natural drainages in rural and urban areas ordinary people are misled by populist slogans and propaganda designed to grab public lands This will end up tattering forests salinising coastal freshwater sources oversilting dams lakes ponds and wells and poisoning aquifers at the hands of toxic industries and mining The fundamental error that oldschool economists and planners make is to believe that natural infrastructures that temper climate invigorate soils buffer us from sea surges and generally help keep us alive are no good to their GDP ambitions This is why forest protection budgets are abysmally inadequate why water tables are falling why floods and droughts have turned more vicious more frequent why the rich are getting richer the poor much much poorer A state of affairs that will worsen as the juggernaut of climate change trundles on with our planet already 20 C warmer than it should be The real last word Real truthful reflections for World Environment Day Indias economy survives because of the stable ecological foundation on which it is built Allow our leaders to shake this foundation much longer and like the proverbial house of cards our economy will come tumbling down MELGHAT TIGERS UNDER ASSAULT AGAIN By Kishor Rithe Maharashtras Melghat Tiger Reserve supports between 40 and 50 tigers plus another 20 or so in the outlying forests The politiciancontractor nexus used tragic malnutrition deaths that took place outside Melghat to build expensive roads and make demands for dams that we managed to stop in the late 1990s However new threats keep popping up like bad pennies whenever someone comes up with a new way to milk taxpayers of money to push through lucrative but useless projects including roads and dams such as the Chikaldhara Pumped Storage Project and the Upper Tapi Stage II The Nature Conservation Society Amravati NCSA BEAG and Sanctuary Asia united with other groups to keep the threats at bay With help from a handful of visionary government officials the adjoining Wan Narnala and Ambabarawa sanctuaries were notified as Critical Tiger Habitats in 2007 along with the original Melghat Wildlife Sanctuary and Gugamal National Park forests Between 2011 and 2015 nine villages opted to be relocated from the southern part of Melghat to access a better quality of life The results were there to see in the shape and form of predator and prey recoveries Today spillover tiger populations have begun dispersing toward Yawal to the west Now after two decades of painstaking work a proposed project to enhance the metregauge track to broad gauge using the alignment of the existing AkolaKhandawa railway line that passes through the Wan sanctuary core of Melghat Tiger Reserve the buffer zone of the reserve in Maharashtra as well as in Madhya Pradesh and the forest area beyond could undo years of good work The existing slowrunning trains have already caused uncounted wildlife deaths This slaughter is now bound to rise The National Board for Wildlife clearly states by policy that linear projects should not be allowed through the core of tiger reserves This is because empirical data proves that increased frequency and speed of trains will take an unacceptable toll of wild species No mitigation attempts can ever hope to eliminate the problem Instead conservationists have suggested that the track be diverted via a new route that will be a mere 10 to 13 km longer but will avoid the present hilly terrain which in any event poses risks to trains particularly if confronted by inclement weather The alternate route would also service a much larger number of villages thus benefiting more humans Legally no infrastructure such as railways stations can in any event be built in the core of Melghat There is already a station and railway infrastructure at Wan road even though there is no village there This increases the workload of the overstretched Forest Department which cannot hope to distinguish poachers from genuine passengers There are two tunnels on the existing railway line inside the Wan Sanctuary Here people routinely stop the train by pulling the chain to surreptitiously collect and transport forest produce and poached derivatives using the Wan and Talai tunnels as cover The traders who operate between Akot and Dhulghat are basically already having a field day Sanctuary readers are requested to write to protest the destruction of Melghat Make these points and send your messages to Suresh Prabhu Minister of Railways Government of India New Delhi

temperate forests the Indian subcontinent is blessed with a unique mix of habitats diverse geographies and microclimates Not surprisingly hundreds of species are found here and nowhere else in the world Yet much of Indias biodiversity lies neglected Some species remain poorly studied or monitored some yet undiscovered and almost all impacted by the relentless destruction of steadily disappearing habitats The IUCN Red List 2018 tells us that 683 species of fauna and a fourth of all flora in India are endemic The evolution of some was shaped by reproductive isolation divergence or hybridisation neoendemism The Narcondam Hornbill is for instance an endemic of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Though fairly similar in appearance it is distinct from its mainland relatives the Blyths Hornbills of Indonesia and New Guinea Some like the purple frog were forced into isolation when their widespread populations became restricted and eventually confined to a smaller area paleoendemism Found only in the Western Ghats the purple frog has been evolving independent of its closest relatives the Sooglossidae frogs of the Seychelles Climate change and the mismanagement of habitats endanger the survival of all the species listed here Sanctuary s Assistant Editors Divya Kilikar and Abinaya Kalyanasundaram picked out a few of Indias lesserknown endemics to showcase the stunning diversity of our beautiful country Sangai Rucervus eldii eldii Photo Laishram Shamungou Range and Distribution Keibul Lamjao National Park Manipur Description A mediumsized russetbrown deer with antlers measuring about 100 cm in length with a short tail large ears and whitish underparts Population Numbers 260 IUCN Status Endangered Not the largest deer but the sangai or browantlered deer is large by human standards Geographic isolation has resulted in a genetically distinct subspecies Weighing close to 100 kg with a body length of 15 m a precariously small population survives in a tiny 15 sq km patch of floating vegetation in the Keibul Lamjao National Park Located in Bishnupur district Manipur south of the saucershaped Loktak lake the muchloved deer that inhabit this Ramsar site are referred to as dancing deer after their prancing gait The humusrich phumdis are buoyant grasslands that float on water As the deer walk these organic rafts bob up and down under their weight making it look as though they are dancing Mitochondrial DNA sequencing has confirmed that the sangai is a genetically distinct species When the monsoon descends the sangai habitat floods and shrinks further The phumdis that settle down during the lean season are now perpetually afloat because of the increased water levels post the construction of the illadvised Ithai barrage built by the National HydroElectric Power Corporation Limited A study published in the journal Environmental Monitoring and Assessment in February 2021 reveals that impacts of the climate crisis is likely to negatively affect the habitat within a few short decades The endangered sangai must also compete for resources with the hog deer and wild boar The isolated population faces the perpetual risk of disease susceptibility and low genetic variability on account of inbreeding and diminished fertility Experts now suggest that relocation to create a second wild satellite population is vital to the survival of the species Over time as they remain flooded the delicate grasslands lose their nutrients and struggle to support the weight of the sangai rendering more areas unsuitable for the species Aside from flooding the phumdis are also ravaged by wildfires Mortalities from disease inbreeding is common within the small isolated sangai population also pose a risk to the species future The Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change in association with the Wildlife Institute of India WII and Manipur Forest Department is working toward sangai conservation using sciencebased approaches and advocacy Dr Ruchi Badola Scientist WII Malabar largespotted civet Viverra civettina Photo P JeganathanPublic Domain Range and Distribution Western Ghats Description Long grey body mottled with black spots a long tail and a doglike head Population Numbers Unknown IUCN Status Critically Endangered While most civet species resemble cats the Malabar civet has a more doglike look The existence of this small carnivore has been hotly debated within the conservation community for decades It was believed to favour nearshallow waterbodies in the evergreen forests of the Western Ghats possibly its only home where it largely foraged on the ground According to the Wildlife Trust of India WTI the last recorded sighting was half a century ago in Keralas Western Ghats forests The species was officially listed as extinct in 1978 Then in 1991 a villager discovered fresh skin that was thought to have belonged to Viverra civettina and this reignited hope of the species survival However a 2010 study by Divya Mudappa researcher and cofounder of the Nature Conservation Foundation NCF together with Nandini Rajamani of IISER opined that a wild Malabar civet had never actually been sighted with any degree of certainty and that its documented ecology was based on speculation On reviewing the specimens collected together with published and unpublished literature the authors wrote that a unique genus Viverra does not and probably never did occur in the wild in southern India Myth or not the fact remains that the rich rainforest home of this missing civet continues to be threatened by anthropogenic pressures and efforts to boost conservation action must be amplified Discrepancies in the early field descriptions suggest that they refer to noncongeneric of another genus species yet most of these descriptions have been repeated almost verbatim until now with no additional information from the wild We present a novel possibility that the genus Viverra does not occur in the wild in southern India and the Malabar civet is not a taxon Divya Mudappa NCF and Nandini Rajamani IISER Madras hedgehog Paraechinus nudiventris Photo Sachin San Range and Distribution Tamil Nadu Kerala

Erode Tiruppur Kanyakumari and Coimbatore districts Description Small porcupinelike body weighing around 300 g with a long snout Population Numbers Exact numbers unknown but declining IUCN Status Least Concern This understudied mammal has in our view been hastily tagged as being of Least Concern in the IUCN Red List The Madras hedgehog or barebellied hedgehog looking for all practical purposes like a creature from a Western movie was once widespread across southeastern India and is just one of three hedgehog species found on the subcontinent A nocturnal insectivorous mammal it is welladapted to dry arid environments Initially the Madras hedgehog was listed only from the scrub and arid regions of Kerala and Tamil Nadu but was later spotted in Andhra Pradesh as well We have no population estimates of the solitary mammal and little is known about its behaviour Dr Brawin Kumar a researcher from Kanyakumari who works at IISERTirupati has studied the species across 16 districts in Tamil Nadu He found no mention of the species even in local folklore Through his surveys and fieldwork he observed that between 2012 and 2017 a mere 18 live sightings were recorded in low elevation grasslands hillocks and in shrubby parts of some urban landscapes The hedgehogs also frequent pasturelands where cattle graze attracted by the influx of insects red sand dunes or Teris along the coast under dried Palmyra tree leaves during the day and on the edges of agricultural lands and dried waterbodies Kumar is now working to highlight the threats faced by the species while raising awareness of its uniqueness and value for the benefit of local communities Wind farms road construction and human disturbance all pose a threat to this littleunderstood hedgehog which also falls victim to the illegal wildlife trade Its flesh and skin are mistakenly believed to have medicinal properties and tribal families store dried hedgehog skin in their kitchens to treat illnesses Dried hedgehog skin mixed with honey is given to children I have observed at least a hundred households stocking up on its skin says Kumar who rues the fact that hunting for Madras hedgehogs is commonplace It is vital to create accurate estimates of hedgehog populations in every district in Tamil Nadu and other range states says Kumar who is working with locals to have a Community Conservation Reserve declared in Tirupur Kumars research has unearthed the presence of the hedgehog in as many as 162 locations Ironically the Madras hedgehog is still not listed on any schedule of the Wild Life Protection Act 1972 nor do any school books mention the species Kumar is working with colleagues to change this by getting young and old community members involved in promoting awareness of the need to protect this captivating mammal For the last three years we have noticed a chilling pattern After every monsoon in Tamil Nadu there are reports of over 1500 Madras hedgehog roadkills This happens because the animals burrows are flooded and being creatures of arid climes they are attracted to the warmth of tarred roads and the abundance of insect food Dr Brawin Kumar Researcher IISERTirupati Anaimalai flying frog Rhacophorus pseudomalabaricus Photo Arpit Parekh Range and Distribution Anamalai hills Western Ghats Description A vibrant leafygreen frog about five centimetres long with protruding eyes and prominent yellow footwebbing Population Numbers Unknown IUCN Status Critically Endangered The Western Ghats is an amphibian paradise at least 117 species of frogs have been recorded here of which 89 are endemics The Anaimalai flying frog is one such thriving in secondary tropical rainforests in the southern Western Ghats The frog has been recorded in six locations in Kerala and Tamil Nadu including the Anamalai and Parambikulam Tiger Reserves as well as habitats outside these Protected Areas A 2015 paper also confirms the presence of the frogs in tea and cardamom plantations in Munnar and Mankulam Kerala where researchers observed nine nests One of the many endless nights spent in the field threw up a sighting of as many as 42 adults The frogs are generally known to favour marshy areas at about 1000 masl where they nest in overhanging vegetation At present the home range and habitat utilisation of the frog outside of the breeding season are unknown and require further research the paper authored by Arun Kanagavel suggests Community members say the frogs consume cardamom though this behaviour has not been observed The range of the Anaimalai flying frog was previously thought to be more limited which underscores the importance of involving communities including farmers into conservation plans as the frogs have been recorded breeding in agricultural fields The species is also referred to as the false Malabar gliding frog owing to its similarity in appearance to the Malabar counterpart Juveniles sport striking zebralike stripes that fade in adulthood Interestingly the Anaimalai flying frog is the only amphibian to be featured on an Indian postage stamp Habitat loss on account of timber extraction threatens the future of this rangerestricted vulnerable amphibian We urgently need to monitor and protect breeding populations in and around our Protected Areas The species may possibly be considered a bad omen among the Mannan tribal community and this might explain

Jatropha glandulifera and Vitex negundo Terrestrial reptiles they burrow their entire bodies into loose soil snout first to escape predators This is a common evasive manoeuvre of skinks also used to burrow underground tunnels This habitat is under serious threat from stone quarrying tourism related infrastructure development and grazing Chethan Kumar Gandla an independent postdoctoral researcher In 2018 he visited the Nagarjunasagar dam area when he first spotted the skink Astonished I took photographs of the species noting details of the location and behaviour Dugong Dugong dugon Photo Julien Millem Public Domain Range and Distribution Gulf of Mannar Gulf of Kutchh Palk Bay and the Andaman and Nicobar islands Description A large greybrown marine mammal with a flattened tail no dorsal fin paddlelike flippers and a bulbous head Population Numbers Unknown IUCN Status Vulnerable Also called sea cows dugongs are described as farmers of seagrasses and are vital to the health of some of the most important carbon sinks on the planet Dugongs trim marine vegetation as they forage thus aiding regeneration Seagrass ecosystems absorb carbon 35 times faster than tropical rainforests They also prevent coastal erosion vital to dealing with erratic weather extremes A diversity of fish breed in seagrasses and this supports fisher communities along the coast A single dugong may consume 40 kg of seagrass in a day According to a 2013 report by Dr K Sivakumar and Aditi Nair of WII if the vegetation is not tall enough dugongs begin to nip at the bottom consuming rhizomes stems and leaves which results in cloudy waters with floating sediment Sohini Dudhat a marine biologist who studied dugongs and seagrass habitats in the Andamans with WII says that the team is currently attempting a visual census using drones According to her the Gulf of Kutchh also hosts a small population While WII has noted a few signs of feeding trails very few actual sightings have been reported by fishers here In Tamil Nadu a larger population thrives but is threatened by hunting The traditional consumption of dugong meat by local communities was once widespread and continues in smaller pockets despite being prohibited Hunting is a concern in North Andaman too though habitat fragmentation is a larger issue particularly since the seagrass meadows have been repeatedly ravaged by tsunamis and climate extremes Globally seagrass habitats which usually occur nearshore are declining at a rate of roughly seven per cent per annum owing to anthropogenic pressures Waycott et al 2009 Green and Short 2003 Their dependence on seagrass beds forces dugongs to remain close to shores leaving them vulnerable to hunting propellor strikes accidental capture in fishing nets and sundry habitat degradation including toxic pollutants and plastic waste Mothers incubate babies for a year or so and give birth to a single offspring once between three and seven years This slow breeding renders them even more vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures Like almost all other marine creatures these gentle onceabundant vegetarians are increasingly falling victim to the human mismanagement of Earths oceans Populations vary in each of the dugongs habitats in India In the Andamans I noticed how vulnerable the seagrass meadows in the Islands are being subjected to natural and anthropogenic pressures Seagrass meadows have been affected by the tsunami possibly due to cyclones changes in land use patterns which alters nutrient flow into the water and sedimentation due to infrastructural development These factors have led to fragmentation of the extensive meadows found 2030 years ago Loss of habitat has severely affected dugong populations not to mention other threats such as accidental net entanglement and hunting which are still prevalent in some areas Sohini Dudhat Marine Biologist Jerdons Courser Rhinoptilus bitorquatus Photo John Gerrard KeulemanPublic Domain Range and Distribution Sri Lankamaleswara Wildlife Sanctuary SLWLS Kadapa District Andhra Pradesh Description Large eyes short yellow bill with black tip and yellow legs Plumage includes a brown breast with two narrow white bands broad white lores and supercilium over dark cheek patches Population Numbers Exact numbers unknown but declining IUCN Status Critically Endangered The only Rhinoptilus species in India this nocturnal bird was believed extinct until its rediscovery in 1986 by Bharat Bhushan an ornithologist at the Bombay Natural History Society BNHS in a village in Kadapa District Andhra Pradesh This site was later designated as the Sri Lankamaleswara Wildlife Sanctuary SLWLS now the only known home of the species The scrub jungle patches with open areas that are visited by the courser face a diversity of threats including encroachments agriculture nonnative plantations livestock grazing construction of check dams quarries and canals On top of this illegal opportunistic trapping by locals is commonplace Between 2010 and 2012 the Bombay Natural History Society BNHS and the Nature Conservation Foundation NCF formulated a joint Species Recovery Plan SRP with the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department APFD also translated into the local language Telugu Nearly 200 camera traps were set up in SLWLS Although several thousand images of nocturnal birds and animals were captured none were of the Jerdons Courser Recently the APFD restarted this SRP but field work has been delayed because of the COVID19 pandemic says P Jeganathan wildlife biologist with NCF who was part of the project in 2010 The last authentic record of the bird was in April 2008 Jeganathan says We have searched using remote cameras in and near the Sri Lankamaleswara Wildlife Sanctuary where suitable habitats exist though the entire area has not been covered and not during all the seasons The construction of the Telugu Ganga Canal around the sanctuary certainly affected suitable habitats but it is difficult to conclude whether the bird has completely disappeared There are several areas that need to be explored and if suitable habitats exist without much disturbance there is a chance that this species occurs there We need more eyes to find this bird and it is not going to be easy The Jerdons Coursers are not seen very often During our surveys we could see their tracks or hear their calls When we looked for them at night as they are nocturnal they would crouch down when our torch beams found them and stay still for long periods of time Once I had to wait nearly 45 minutes for the bird to get up P Jeganathan Wildlife Biologist Southern birdwing butterfly Troides minos Photo Nitin Shenoy Range and Distribution Southern and central Western Ghats of Karnataka and Kerala Rarely seen in southern Maharashtra and northern Goa Description Large butterfly with a 140190 mm wingspan Forewings are deepblack and hindwings goldenyellow with black borders Female has triangular spots on hindwings Population Numbers Data Deficient IUCN Status Least Concern With its striking black white and yellow wings this jewel of a butterfly is endemic to south India and is the secondlargest butterfly in India It was declared the state butterfly of Karnataka its colours matching the state flag Found at elevations of 2700 masl in Western Ghats habitats varying from lowland evergreen coastal forests to mixed deciduous forests dry scrub and agricultural fields recent reports of its presence have been received from Bengaluru near the National Centre for Biological Sciences NCBS and the Bengaluru University During and postmonsoons southern birdwings can be spotted gently circling and sailing among treetops They are avoided by predators their bright colours indicating unpalatability a result of the aristolochic acids ingested as caterpillars Females lay eggs on creepers and climbers of the family Aristolochiaceae Aristolochia indica A tagala and Thottea siliquosa As adults they feed on nectar from Lantana Clerodendrum Ixora and Mussaenda flowers Given its restricted range and endemicity the IUCN recommends ongoing monitoring of the species During field work in Goa I would often observe the southern birdwing flit high above the forest canopy It would almost seem like a bird gliding with its beautiful blackyellow wings against the blue sky I have also searched for its host plants to observe the caterpillars but this is difficult in the forest Even working as a butterfly researcher I have only seen the caterpillar once during my entire study Ravi Jambhekar Ecologist and Botanical Illustrator Mishmi Wren Babbler Spelaeornis badeigularis Photo Mike Prince Public Domain Range and Distribution Mishmi hills Arunachal Pradesh Description A small greybrown bird with a reddishbrown throat and blackandwhite scalloped patterns on the belly Population Numbers 15007000 IUCN Status Vulnerable The Mishmi Wren Babbler also called the Rustythroated Wren Babbler was an enigma for ages It was first described in 1947 by S Dillon Ripley from a single specimen collected in Dreyi in the Mishmi hills of eastern Arunachal Pradesh The bird was not spotted again for several decades In 2004 two scientists Ben King and Julian H Donahue set off from Roing towards the Mayodia pass in the Mishmi hills in search of the babbler They played the calls of a close relative the Rufousthroated Wren Babbler Spelaeornis caudatus and to their delight the Mishmi Wren Babbler called back Within 90 minutes they spotted the furtive and tiny bird as it flitted amidst the roadside trees In the course of their expedition a total of 17 individuals were spotted in low dense secondary forest vegetation along roadsides at elevations between 17002400 masl Until 2017 the only known location of the species was near Mayodia pass after which it was reported from further north on the way to Anini Conservationist and ornithologist Shashank Dalvi who coauthored a paper on the species range extension says the species is highly territorial in summer as well as winter months and found exclusively in the undergrowth in the cloud forests The Mishmi Wren Babbler is one of the species in Northeast India which shows allopatric as well as parapatric speciation Due to allopatric speciation at midelevation it does not share the same range with some of its sister taxa like the Rufousthroated Wren Babbler and Naga Wren Babbler However elevationally it does share the same range with the Barwinged Wren Babbler Due to speciation Spelaeornis Wren Babblers found at midelevation have independent geographic distribution However it has been observed that the Mishmi Wren Babbler and Rufousthroated Wren Babbler share their distribution with the Barwinged Wren Babbler in terms of elevation on a mountain range where they have a small overlap Dam construction and road widening threaten the future of this small bird Climate change will also be a major threat for this species in the future Several species in the eastern Himalaya are already migrating upwards Shashank adds Even though the Mishmi Wren Babbler is highly localised distribution wise I have seen this species on every visit in the undergrowth along the main Mishmi hills road but always between 15002200 masl Shashank Dalvi Conservationist and Ornithologist Myristica species Photo Siddarth Machado Public Domain Range and Distribution Uttara Kannada district Karnataka southern Kerala Goa and northern Western Ghats Maharashtra Description Swamp ecosystems with many endangered species of flora and specialised fauna A rare and ancient ecosystem Myristica swamps were once thriving across the lowlying valleys of the Western Ghats These groves were traditionally considered sacred by local communities across the Western Ghats However much of the cultural knowledge has been lost over time These tropical freshwater swamp forests are home to several species of the Myristicaceae family believed to be the most primitive flowering plants in the world dating back to the Early Eocene These evergreen trees have evolved to survive the waterinundated swamps by possessing two types of strangelooking roots knee roots that stand out of the ground and exchange gases and stilt roots which emerge from the trunk and keep the tree erect in the soft wet alluvial soil They form a dense closedcanopy top creating a unique ecosystem which harbours several endemic species The predominant species Gymnacranthera canarica and Myristica fatua magnifica are listed as Vulnerable and Endangered according to the IUCN Red List The Myristica sapphire Calocypha laidlawi is an endemic damselfly species that breeds in forest streams and rivers flowing through the Myristica swamps Dark bodied with azure streaks and dark violetmetallic gossamer wings it is often seen perched in the shade either on submerged logs or twigs The Myristica bambootail Phylloneura westermanni bottom is another endemic damselfly species that lives in small colonies on overhanging plants Myristica swamps now survive in fragmented patches most having been converted to paddy fields monoculture tree plantations or submerged under dam reservoirs These swamps ability to act as sponges storing water during monsoon and slowly releasing them into streams through the year make them vital infrastructures for water storage and carbon sequestration apart from the fact that they support a diversity of floral and faunal biodiversity Myristica Bambootail in Wayanad Photo Jignasu Dolia

you sail for 537 km southeast of Port Blair the capital of Andaman and Nicobar Islands you reach the southernmost tip of India the mysterious Great Nicobar Island 646N 720N and 9337E 9356E The land of the Nicobarese and Shompen tribes the land of the Nicobarese crabeating macaque the Nicobarese tree shrew the Great Nicobar Serpenteagle the saltwater crocodile the Edible Nest Swiftlet the dugong and uncounted more The island is largely unexplored even by field biologists and presents natures canvas at its best with dense rainforests lush coral reefs and with tribes living in relative isolation from the world Lying within the most seismically active regions of the world the ring of fire the island finds its earliest recorded mention in the Sri Lankan Pali Buddhist chronicles 3rd4th century as Naggadipa nagga meaning naked in Pali language The name Kala Pani Black Waters is etched in almost every Indians psyche because the AN Islands were used as a colonial prison and penal settlement by the British during Indias freedom struggle As a whole this fragile archipelago has been ravaged down the years and the many atrocities against the tribes over few centuries is well documented particularly during its occupation by the Danish 17th century the British 1868 and the Japanese 194245 Finally in 1950 the Islands became a part of free India but did not quite stop the ecological downslide Because the Great Nicobar Island lies far from the Indian mainland thus far it has largely escaped the attention of developers and is consequently a treasuretrove of biodiversity The Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve therefore remains a wonderland of tropical wet evergreen forests mountain ranges and coastal plains Predictably isolation has resulted in high endemism with such unique species as the Nicobar Megapode found nowhere else in the world The rare Nicobar Megapode Megapodius nicobariensis Photo Courtesy Pankaj Sekhsaria The Campbell Bay National Park on the northern part of the island and Galathea National Park in the southern interior form part of a Tribal Reserve and a Zoological Survey of India survey of the 885 sq km island reveals 1767 species of fauna 558 terrestrial and 1209 marine which is why in 2013 UNESCO justifiably declared this Eden a Biosphere Reserve under its Man Biosphere MAB programme With advances in science technology and transportation there are few places in the tropical world where a sense of mystery still prevails but surely the Great Nicobar is one such Anthropologists have studied two forestdwelling tribes the huntergatherer Mongoloid Shompens about 200 in number who live in the forests along the rivers and streams and the Nicobarese around 300 also Mongoloid who used to live in settlements along the west coast until the devastating tsunami of 2004 post which they were resettled to the north coast Additionally the Great Nicobar now has settlers and mainlanders numbering over 8000 who occupy the southeast coast where they practice agriculture horticulture and fishing The coastal forest of Galathea National Park above in the south of the island along with the Campbell Bay National Park in the north sit within the region that has been declared as a Tribal Reserve Photo Courtesy Pankaj Sekhsaria Wheels of Change After living in relative equilibrium the Nicobarese were seriously jolted by the 2004 tsunami Besides the huge loss of life and property a multitude of factors emerged some on account of official posttsunami relief efforts Dr Ajay Saini reveals how the governments culturallyinsensitive disaster relief led to crosscultural exposure and disengagement from traditional practices that has forever changed their way of living Large monetary compensation and exposure to modern amenities have sucked the Nicobarese into the whirlwind of consumerism and many are now not willing to go back to the lifestyles of their ancestors Undoubtedly wellmeaning these humanitarian interventions have not merely undermined selfsufficient livelihood practices social structures and the political selforganisation of the community but have probably left the Nicobarese people almost permanently dependent on outside support What is more settlers from the mainland are now mounting pressure for more development and inappropriate livelihoods on the island For decades there was no tourism allowed below the 10degree channel but today fresh tourism projects are being routinely proposed and these just might prove to be the last load on the camels back and could destabilise the ecology of the island driving many species to extinction The isolation of the Great Nicobar Island has resulted in a large number of endemic species The 885 sq km island is home to nearly 1767 faunal species including the Nicobar tree skink Dasia nicobarensis Photo Courtesy Snehaa Sundaram And more than just wild species could be lost forever Eight years ago in February 2010 as I was surfing the Internet at my New Delhi home I read about Boa Sr of the Bo tribe from the North Andaman Island and how she was the last remaining speaker of the Bo language I looked at her face looking right back at me through the screen and I felt her loneliness She belonged to one of the oldest tribes on Earth with her died a thousand secrets of her people and their lives on the islands This is a reminder that the threat of extinction looms large for the tribal people of Great Nicobar too With the loss of biodiversity habitats and native languages we also lose indigenous knowledge including the traditional ecological comprehension of the role of species and landscapes that native communities had kept alive for eons Modernisation poses still more dangers The archipelago is separated by over 650 nautical miles from the Indian mainland and offers a vital geostrategic advantage to India and this places it at risk from further economic and defence development With China as a looming threat in the Indian Ocean India plans to augment its military capability here to safeguard its interests in the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean Translated this means more infrastructure more inappropriate from a biodiversity point of view technological intrusions such as upgradation of the naval air station at Campbell Bay Easy accessibility is inevitably followed by economic invasion The vast Exclusive Economic Zone around this zone accounts for almost 30 per cent of Indias entire EEZ What further complicates this threat to the biological existence of plant and animal lifeforms is the fact that the AN Islands sit astride some of the busiest shipping lanes of the Indian Ocean Facilities are being mooted to build new capacity for cargo to be transported to East Asian economies to cater to Indian interests by using the strategicallylocated mouth of the Malacca Straits This gateway to the Far East is an 850 km channel and carries 40 per cent of the worlds freight trade which annually sees over 94000 merchant ships sailing to and from China South Korea and Japan alone The subsequent land use change and impact on biodiversity and culture in the AN Islands has been evident in the last few years specially post tsunami There are plans underway for upscaled integrated tourism and enhanced infrastructure Marine debris already lines the pristine beaches of Great Nicobar threatening the breeding grounds of leatherback turtles their hatchlings and other marine life Photo Pankaj Sekhsaria In all likelihood humungous quantities of marine plastic debris originate from fishing or mariculture activity and from irresponsible ship traffic The wheels of change for Great Nicobar and other parts of the AN Islands are in motion and it will take a visionary great balancing act to protect this wonderland Gross Island Happiness Index Increasingly there has been recognition that measurements such as GDP Gross Domestic Product do not capture the overall wellbeing of a nations citizens Its hard to not be impressed by the motivations behind Bhutans concept of GHP Gross National Happiness for its people This involves measuring prosperity based on a broad range of factors including spiritual physical social and environmental health of its citizens and natural environment Environmental conservation and sustainability are at the heart of Bhutans political agenda which stems from an intrinsic belief that happiness is dependent on wellbeing that in turn results from close contact and balance with nature Islands including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are specially well placed to adopt such a system of measuring prosperity Island nations world over have a higher than average level of life expectancy lifesatisfaction and a lowerthanaverage ecological footprint when calculated on the lines of the Happy Planet Index HPI Perhaps geographical isolation from the mainland protects locals from mainland disturbances and helps them retain their unique cultural ecological and social values Maintaining ecological social and cultural balance for the AN Islands is very much in line with UNESCOs vision for the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve A Gross Island Happiness Index for these islands would be a shining example for the rest of our country indeed the world to emulate Photo Pankaj Sekhsaria For now the Great Nicobar Island waits patiently for its story to unfold Even as the tussle between human greed and nature continues the islands happen to be among the most biodiverse places on the planet teeming with life forms All these however remain at the mercy of one species searching for gratification in all the wrong places Exactly a decade ago when I first visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands I found myself taken by the stunning raw healing beauty of the islands This marked the beginning of my wildlife conservation journey Here I would spend endless hours diving and walking with local guides while exploring coral reefs and rainforests My love affair with these islands began underwater where I lost myself in the Bay of Bengal but found happiness What is MAB The Man Biosphere MAB programme combines natural and social sciences economics and education to improve human

Shubhobroto Ghosh W hen the Coronavirus pandemic first struck in 2020 it brought to the forefront certain harsh realities that we had not faced before Among the most compelling of those realities was the fact that like billions worldwide who were fortunate not to be forced to migrate or exposed to the deadly virus we had to stay indoors in our flat in Motinagar in New Delhi Living under confined conditions it came as a pleasant surprise when certain occasions during this period revealed delightful sights The presence of birds many varieties of which I had never thought existed in the area were initially fleeting distractions that soon turned into prolonged sessions of intensive birdwatching for us I observed several species of which one stands out during the otherwise traumatic time of 2020 and 2021 Roseringed Parakeets Parrots of all kinds have been my favourites since childhood and their beauty of appearance intelligence and ability to mimic a wide range of sounds including human speech have enchanted me I saw parrots mostly in captivity in the absolutely brutal tiny cages where they were hardly ever able to extend their bodies chained in rings and with their wings clipped Macaws and cockatoos enchanted me but the species that I encountered most frequently was the Roseringed Parakeet a gorgeouslycoloured and raucous bird that is still kept illegally as a pet in many homes in India Bearing the painful memories of these unfortunate captive birds in mind it was a delight to observe freeliving parakeets indulging in all manner of behaviours right in front of my eyes My wife Payel Biswas and I spent hours observing a whole population of these endearing parakeets that kept us entertained with their antics One of their refuges was an Ashoka tree Saraca asoca where they would perch and often preen themselves and one another At a time of grave depression Roseringed Parakeets treepies Yellowfooted Green Pigeons Purple Sunbirds Redvented and Redwhiskered Bulbuls and more cheered us up even in the midst of the darkest gloom Payel and I were even able to witness flocks or murmurations of Rosy Starlings also called Rosy Pastors during their winter migration to India A Roseringed Parakeet Psittacula krameri Photo Shubhobroto Ghosh Notably we even saw Painted Storks and Black Ibises flying over the terrace of our home Not in our wildest dreams had we imagined that some storks and ibises would actually fly above our terrace Watching birds offers many pleasures as the late Indian ornithologist S\u00e1lim Ali also stated among them is the opportunity to engage in observing the behaviour of creatures that so fascinated humans that it led to the invention of aircraft We had to shift our home recently because a new construction came up that led to our flat being damaged Many parakeets that used to gather nearby also abandoned their retreat on account of the construction Fortunately at our new residence at Ramesh Nagar we noticed a robust presence of birds as well as evidenced by Payels recent sighting of a Blue Rock Thrush A Blue Rock Thrush Monticola solitarius Photo Payel Biswas We hope that more people will be able to observe and document the presence of birds and other animals that share our living spaces all across the country The continued happiness derived from birdwatching in domestic situations also fits in nicely with my professional duties since the motto of World Animal Protection is Wildlife Belongs in the Wild Birds ought to be cherished flying free not in cages that are in truth little more than prisons set up in our homes A Yellowfooted Green Pigeon Treron phoenicoptera near the authors home Photo Shubhobroto Ghosh In Appreciation of our Feathered Bipeds In August 2022 the Zoological Survey of India ZSI published Birds of India a photographic field guide to encourage birdwatching and scientific study of birds in India Shubhobroto Ghosh World Animal Protection Research Manager spoke with Dr Gopinathan Maheswaran Scientist E in the Bird Section ZSI about this book and how it could enhance the appreciation of avian life in India What is the significance of this new book on birds This is the first photographic field guide from ZSI in a century and depicts all bird species found within Indian states and Union Territories We have many field guides in India but a majority of them include drawings rather than images that accompany speciesdescriptions This guide has clear pointers revealing the identifying characteristics of species The text has been kept to a minimum but important distinguishing colours and markings will help birders identify birds in the field What are the principal features of this book It includes all 1331 bird species of India including 100odd vagrants Wherever possible we have included photos of both male and female avians as some species display clear sexual dimorphism For waders of which 90 per cent are winter migrants we have used images depicting winter and summer plumage since many waders develop different colouration in the breeding season making accurate field identification difficult Our field guide should help birders differentiate individual species in breeding and nonbreeding seasons How can this book help people appreciate birds better and pave the way for improved photography In India more people are taking to bird photography as a hobby thanks to the availability of inexpensive high quality digital cameras This encourages more people to take up bird photography which ultimately supports conservation Social media platforms too have helped by offering people outlets to showcase their images How and why is it important to tackle the bird trade Birds have a vital ecological role to play We have included information on threat levels as listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN People using this field guide can identify a species that is illegally being sold in the local market and alert the enforcement authority immediately How can this book help encourage the study of birds This book will guide both beginners and professional birders in identifying species in the field Retail price has been kept low to enable youngsters to enter the wonderful world of birdwatching and also to encourage field research by scientists and scientific staff of governmentfunded institutions to enhance the quality of their science communication Shubhobroto Ghosh Wildlife Research Manager World Animal Protection in India is the author of Dreaming in Calcutta and Channel

island What do you see Chances are you imagined a warm climate palm trees and pristine beaches Palms or members of the botanical family Arecaceae have become representative of island ecosystems and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are no exception The island group formed around the same time as the Indonesian archipelago and by the same tectonic event that created the Himalaya plays host to 33 species of palms with 18 of them being endemic to the islands One of these in particular Bentinckia nicobarica or the Nicobar palm is restricted to the Nicobar Islands and listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of species Now with the islands facing the pressures of climate change and increasing urban and infrastructural development the Nicobar palm and other endemic species are at real threat of extinction However the case of the Nicobar palm is of special concern since island extinctions are particularly harmful First we have to ask what makes island biodiversity so interesting The Nicobar palm Bentinckia nicobarica is an elegant palm tree with arching leaves and a greyish white trunk It is restricted to the Nicobar Islands and listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of species Photo Public domainYercaud Elango The two forefathers of evolution Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace both struck upon their theories of evolution by natural selection while exploring archipelagos Darwin famously noticed how finches in the Galapagos islands seemed to diversify into different forms on different islands and Wallace noticed similar patterns with birds and butterflies in the Malay islands Islands form a natural laboratory for evolution because they are geographically isolated This causes the preservation of small genetic variations in any species which makes it to the island since they cannot breed with a mainland population This process of genetic isolation and amplification accelerates speciation This natural pattern is in principle why islands show such high rates of endemism and the same goes for plants Palms in particular are quick to colonise islands Several palms have edible or buoyant fruits and seeds allowing them to disperse to islands more effectively Their tough leaves and slender flexible stems make them ideal to withstand harsh and exposed island conditions and their ability to reproduce asexually many palms form clonal clusters or colonies ensures they can establish a large population quickly These traits have facilitated the speciation of palms into over 2600 species and have kept them a part of tropical ecosystems for 80 million years Unfortunately this high rate of endemism among this taxon means that many palms have a very limited geographical range and face immediate threats of extinction This specimen of Mauritian bottle palm Hyophorbe amaricaulis from Curepipe Botanic Gardens in Mauritius is an endling last known individual of its species Photo Public domainCoolthwikipedia Palms are vital to humans They form one of the oldest crops with records of datepalm cultivation in Egypt existing from almost 5000 years ago After grasses and beans palms form the third most agriculturally important plant family in the world In India the coconut palm alone annually contributes 38 billion USD to the countrys economy Aside from human uses palms form vital habitat for animal biodiversity help in stabilising soil and mitigating the effects of natural disasters and serve as a model system to study biogeographic evolution In the case of the Nicobar palm it exists in increasingly smaller habitat fragments and is critically understudied in terms of its interactions with other plants and animals Previously assessed by the IUCN 25 years ago its current status of preservation is mostly unknown On Mauritius the endemic Mauritian bottle palm Hyophorbe amaricaulis is reduced to a single remaining specimen the last representative of a population gradually whittled down by habitat loss If immediate conservation action is not taken the Nicobar palm and other unique species stand to face a similar unsettling fate Such species serve as urgent reminders of the need to pay special conservation attention to islands and recognise in policy and in public dialogue the unique evolutionary history and biodiversity they represent Further reading Eiserhardt Wolf L et al Geographical Ecology of the Palms

foxes because of the British books and folktales I read as a child I knew they visited cities were considered chalaak and they had bushy tails and long whiskers I dont remember how old I was but the first time I stared into the eyes of a fox cub was on the front cover of Sanctuary Cub magazine Memory is a fuzzy beast but I know I reached out to touch the orange bristly fur wondering if the magazine only featured baby animals given its name With every turn of a page I found the answers to my many many questions about wildlife and forests and that the fox is much more than the caricature its reduced to in pedantic tales Fed on a robust diet of David Attenborough films Sanctuary Asia magazines and books about animals I never imagined that years later I would get to meet the magazines founding editor Bittu Sahgal and be almost immediately swept into a whirlwind of anecdotes and warmth I walked into the Nariman Point office of Sanctuary Asia many thoughts racing through my head First I was transported into the world of 70s films where Vidya Sinha and Amol Palekar caught buses to their offices and stood in line to get into the lifts I got off one such lift and walked into the office where everyone was glued to their screens and magnificent photos of tigers and habitats dotted the walls It was Bittu who first packed me off to a tiger reserve how will you want to defend wildlife if you dont soak up forests As I met my first treepie my first tiger and my first leopard I understood what he meant He pushed Rachel Carsons writings on me You have to read Silent Spring today So I did and followed it up with more including The Sense of Wonder a book that continues to define a lot of my writing for children It was with the Sanctuary Asia team that I first visited Sanjay Gandhi National Park my breath catching it was of course not the climb coughcough as we stood by the Kanheri Caves watching Roseringed Parakeets threading their way through broccolitopped canopies that hugged the city I loved A reminder that wildlife is in our backyards we just need to look It was with them that I uncovered one of the citys worst kept secrets flamingoes our team

about the magnificence of the wild world and to bring together hopes and minds to demand a future where the air is breathable the water is pure food is aplenty and our forests teem with life So many young people who passed through its offices have made their way into different corners of the world reporting on nature writing about climate change advocating for environmental justice publishing academic papers all because of this one spark Every time an Earth Hero was recognised at the Sanctuary Awards no matter how jaded I felt it was a reminder that hope floats in actions One spark told me that its the bacha party that has the power to change the world Even now when Bittu walks into a room full of children he leaves behind a sense of wonder a yearning for change in the face of the climate crisis and a curiosity of the natural world he gave them a sneakpeek into Its that belief which reminds me when I write books for children that children care they are curious and its our responsibility to foster that sense of wonder That is Sanctuary s magic at 40 Just like tree rings they are keepers of Indias natural history stories advocates for change and always quiet champions of

trafficked mammal in the world the pangolin Pangolins in Peril and the work of one NGO that is working to protect the species In this issue BK Sharma brings home the enormity of the situation and why 2019 was one of the worst years for pangolins B utchered in the thousands and smuggled in tons seizure of consignment after consignment of scales and meat of pangolins worldwide has showed the true depth of the organised network of the global trade in pangolins The volume of illicit trafficking clearly demonstrates that pangolin smuggling is not just an issue of species conservation but of an organised transnational crime valued at billions of dollars It is estimated that up to 200000 individuals are taken from the wild every year across Africa and Asia to meet the demand in China Vietnam and many other countries In the runup to World Pangolin Day on February 15 the Wildlife Justice Commission an international foundation based in The Hague Netherlands published a report Scaling Up The Rapid Growth in the trafficking of Pangolin Scales 201619 The report was based on secondary sources and supplemented by independent investigations conducted by the Commission It analysed seizures of pangolin scales weighing 500 or more kilogrammes as only such large consignments could possibly be linked to organised crime The findings are devastating In a fouryear period 201619 the report recorded 52 seizures involving 2064 tons of scales This translated into tens of thousands of annihilated pangolins Scales seized from pangolin traffickers in Nigeria Despite protection under the Endangered Species Act of Nigeria which prohibits capture or local and international trade of the pangolin over half of all seizures of the species since 2016 have been linked to this African country DR Congo and Cameroon are the other two big suppliers Image Courtesy USAID Wildlife Asia Yet this accounts for only a fraction of the total volume of illegal trafficking Twentyseven countries were identified as source transit and destination of the trade see box below Six countries namely China Vietnam Singapore Hong Kong Nigeria and DR Congo are linked to 94 per cent of seizures With the Asian pangolin population at an alltime low and shrinking further because of largescale poaching the supply source has shifted to African pangolins Nigeria with large Chinese expatriates is the biggest consumer of pangolin meat and is the export hub of the international trade DR Congo and Cameroon are the other two big suppliers Since 2018 Vietnam has replaced China as the biggest recipient country notwithstanding its strict penal provisions prescribing up to 15 years of imprisonment if convicted NigeriaSingaporeVietnam is the most significant smuggling sea route After the ban of domestic ivory trade by China in 2018 ivory prices plummeted and hence international syndicates have switched over to the trade of pangolin scales to maintain their profits The Indian Scenario The TRAFFIC study Scale of Pangolin Trade in India revealed that during 20092017 scales and other body parts involving 5772 pangolins were seized by law enforcement agencies in India In total the country recorded 90 seizures 83 were of scales and seven were of meat and dead or live pangolins Manipur reported the highest number with 32 seizures 36 per cent followed by Tamil Nadu which recorded nine seizures Interestingly Manipur did not record any seizure after 2015 indicating a shift in the trade route via Nepal to China or Vietnam The study also revealed that during 20092013 most of the seizures took place in Northeast India However states like Maharashtra Karnataka Odisha and Tamil Nadu reported maximum seizures during 201317 The same trend continued thereafter Over the years Odisha has emerged as one of the hot beds of the pangolin trade Starting from an innocuous seizure of five kilogrammes of scales from one Samsuddin Khan at Takera check gate Nayagarh district in June 2018 the Special Task Force STF of the Odisha Crime Branch unearthed a major racket extending to Myanmar and China Local accomplices Allarakha Khan Rabani Khan and Md Riyaz were arrested and antecedent verification revealed their involvement in a series of smuggling cases registered in the Pench Tiger Reserve of Seoni district and in Balaghat district Madhya Pradesh Samsuddin a veteran wildlife trafficker was arrested way back in 1996 for possession of 20 leopard skins Investigation revealed that scales were being collected from poachers in Kalahandi Kandhmal and Boudh districts of Odisha and also from Chhattisgarh Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra The scales were being transported to Guwahati by train or truck or through couriers This led to the arrest of Amir Hussain Lashkar of Silchar and his interrogation led the STF sleuths to arrest Lalthan alias Lalten Kunga of Mizoram the main conduit in smuggling scales to Myanmar and then to China Investigation also revealed that Lashkar and Lalthan were earlier arrested by Madhya Pradesh Forest officials in connection with seizures of wildlife products including pangolin scales The STF has now got a Letter Rogatory issued by the competent court requesting Myanmar authorities to share information on four Burmese nationals who operate the extended link of the international racket Undivided Koraput district of Odisha has been a traditional hunting ground of poachers and traffickers Two groups of 12 accused were arrested in December 2018 in Raygada and Malkangiri two live pangolins were seized In January 2019 Forest officials arrested eight accused in Malkangiri a live pangolin was recovered Nawarangpur Police arrested three persons and seized a pangolin in November 2019 Mayurbhanj the northern most bordering district with its abundant wildlife in the Similipal Reserve Forest is also a favourite poaching ground of organised syndicates STF of State Crime Branch busted a major trafficking ring in December 2018 it arrested four persons and seized a mother and baby pangolin duo being offered for sale at an exorbitant amount Seven residents of the district were arrested in November 2018 in West Midnapore district of Bengal with a dead pangolin inside a bag that had possibly died of asphyxia It was being taken by car to Alipurduar of North Bengal bordering Bhutan for delivery to unknown persons who would have taken it to China In October 2019 forest officials arrested six poachers and seized scales of three pangolins in the outskirts of the Similipal Reserve Forest officials of Athagarh in Odisha busted a huge gang of pangolin smugglers in November 2019 and arrested more than 12 members of the organised network from different parts of the state Investigations revealed that the accused were trading live pangolins and scales online by forming Whatsapp groups in which videos and photos were shared with potential customers often based outside the country and details communicated in codes to conceal the transactions Modus Operandi Investigations have revealed that nomadic tribal communities like Sapera and Bawarias with their traditional hunting skills and excellent topographic knowledge are the initial links of the poaching chain Forests of Maharashtra Chhattisgarh Madhya Pradesh Odisha and Karnataka are the main procurement grounds of pangolins and scales which are then sent to middlemen based in Kolkata and Siliguri in West Bengal Moreh and Churachandrapur in Manipur Guwahati and Silchar in Assam Aizwal and Vairengte in Mizoram Researchers with the Londonbased NGO World Animal Protection and Oxford University found that the Biate Dimasa and Karbi tribes of Assam hunt pangolins for meat consumption and for scales for substantial commercial gains in the cities or to middlemen from cities Current preferred trade routes are via Bengal to Nepal and Bhutan or via Manipur and Mizoram to Myanmar with China being the ultimate destination The other smuggling route is from Jammu Himachal Pradesh Uttarakhand and Haryana across the open border with Nepal and then over new roads being built across the Himalayan mountains to China Market preference as evident from repeated seizures has shifted to live pangolins which fetch a high price depending on the species and size The trade is going online with Whatsapp groups to share photos videos and other details communicated in code Transportation takes place through truck train and postal packets but instances of sellers carrying the contraband in cars to bordering areas have also surfaced Members of organised syndicates across the borders in Myanmar and Nepal have been identified with names and cell numbers and series of Letter Rogatories as well as requests made according to Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties MLAT sent but no concrete result for extradition or prosecution seem to have materialised so far The Legal Response Acknowledging the phenomenal increase in transborder smuggling the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES upgraded all eight pangolin species to Appendix1 at the Conference of Parties COP in South Africa in 2016 banning their trade completely The COP adopted Resolution 1710 urging all member countries to ensure strict enforcement control to address illegal trade implement comprehensive national legislations and make provision for deterrent punishment Many countries amended their national legislations to provide for stricter punishment for killing trading or possessing pangolins or their body parts Still only just 17 pangolin range states have legislations that meet CITES requirements 31 have legislations which fall far short of CITES stipulations and hence fail to act as effective deterrence A workshop being held in the Khao Yai National Park Training Centre Thailand to train police and customs officers and USAID Asias Wildlife Quarantine Centre staff in safe effective techniques on handling stressed or injured pangolins The workshop also introduces them to protocol on pangolin rehabilitation and release into the wild Image courtesy USAID Wildlife Asia Among the source countries Cameroon enacted a new legislation in 2017 which provides for prison up to three years and penalty of three to 10 million CFA Francs 5300 to 17000 for pangolin killing or trafficking The Endangered Species Act of Nigeria prohibits capture or local and international trade of pangolins and provides for a fine of US 1500 andor imprisonment up to five years for the first offence In DR Congo anyone found guilty of killing hurting capturing or possessing a fully protected animal including the pangolin faces one to 10 years in prison andor a fine of five to 10 million Congolese francs US 550011000 Trafficking internationally carries a heftier punishment five to 10 years in jail andor fine of 25 to 100 million Congolese Francs US 27000110000 In Uganda illegal possession of wildlife products including of the pangolin carries a penalty up to five years imprisonment and a fine of not less than one million Shillings or both Punishment however is lax in most of the transit countries which have witnessed huge seizures of pangolin scales in the recent past Singapore provides for two years in prison and a fine up to US 370000 while Malaysias penal laws prescribe imprisonment up to three years and a fine of RM 50000 to 100000 Philippines has the least punishment with prison of up to three months while Hong Kong recently amended its laws to prescribe tough punishment of jail term up to 10 years and fine up to HK 10 million equivalent to US 13 million in case of conviction for illegal trading of Schedule1 species including the pangolin The destination countries however have amended their laws and now provide for fairly deterrent punishment regimes In Vietnam pangolins are protected by the Revised Penal Code of 2017 that took effect on January 1 2018 Killing trafficking transporting trading storing selling of endangered species products are illegal Individual violators can be imprisoned up to 15 years or fined up to five billion Vietnamese Dong US 213328 Lao PDR promulgated a new Penal Code May 2017 with proclamation on October 17 2018 raising penalties to a maximum of LAK 10 million 1252 and imprisonment terms of three months to five years for domestic wildlife trafficking offences The Penal Code also stipulated imprisonment for five to 10 years and a fine triple the value of the item in question if the offender was part of transnational organised crime Chinese laws are not publicised but some recent convictions in illegal pangolin trade resulted in sentencing of the accused to five years in prison In the subcontinent the Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972 as amended stipulates that an offence against the pangolin which is a Schedule1 species shall be punishable with imprisonment which shall not be less than three years but may extend up to seven years and a fine up to Rs 10000 In Nepal the pangolin is listed as a protected species Killing poaching transporting selling or buying them is punishable with fine up to one million Nepalese Rupees US 9000 andor imprisonment up to 15 years Myanmar penal law provides that a person convicted of killing hunting wounding or trading in the pangolin or its body parts can be jailed for 3 to 10 years and fined up to one million Kyat US 668 The Way Ahead Severity of statute however does not guarantee deterrence as organised networks driven by strong market demand and lucrative profit margins manage to find loopholes to escape punishments Many impressive seizures are not followed either by meticulous investigation or painstaking prosecution the two cornerstones of any conviction Often couriers and middlemen are caught while the masterminds remain faceless and untraceable The Philippine pangolin or Palawan pangolin Manis culionensis locally known as balintong is an endemic found in the forests and grasslands of the Palawan province Though it is moderately common within its limited range the species is heavily hunted for its scales and meat Image Courtesy Gregg Yan In this gloomy scenario however still there are some rays of hope for pangolins The Interpol and World Customs Organisation launched Operation Thunder ball involving 109 countries in June 2019 which succeeded in identifying trade routes and led to the seizure of half a tonne of pangolin scales in Nigeria Nepal drew up a Pangolin Conservation Action Plan for 20182022 which aims to secure the pangolin population against emerging threats and recovery in the wild with focus on curbing poaching and control of the illegal trade of pangolins Wildlife conservation groups sued the federal administration in the US by filing a lawsuit in the District Court of Columbia seeking protection of pangolins under the Endangered Species Act which will prohibit import and interstate sale of pangolin parts in the country except for scientific and conservation purposes Singapore which witnessed the most spectacular seizures in 2019 has been urged by the international community to increase the maximum jail term for wildlife crime which is two years and well below the regional average of eight years In September 2019 two Malawian nationals were sentenced to three years in prison by a court in Lilongwe the capital for possession and smuggling of pangolins In July 2019 a Philippine court convicted three men for being in possession of 10 Philippine pangolins but the statutory penalty being light the court sentenced each poacher to three months of imprisonment and a fine of 20000 pesos or about US 385 Believed to be the first conviction under the amended law which guaranteed better protection to the pangolin in May 2019 a national of mainland China was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment for smuggling 48 kg of pangolin scales into Hong Kong In the citys second conviction two men from mainland China were sentenced to 27 months of imprisonment in May 2020 for trafficking 100 kg of pangolin scales from DR Congo Suspecting pangolins to be a possible host for spread of the novel coronavirus COVID19 China in February announced a permanent and comprehensive ban on trade of wild animals as food a major step towards conserving wildlife including the imperiled pangolin There is however a huge trade in pangolins which is not related to consumption but to its medicinal use and conservationists argue that this shall continue through illegal trafficking and farming of pangolins they have demanded for an unequivocal ban of wildlife trade and farming for any purpose whatsoever There is still a long way to go for the establishment of an effective legal and administrative regime in many destination countries which alone can effectively protect pangolins from being mercilessly annihilated in source countries by organised transnational criminal networks Major Seizures in India Maharashtra In October 2018 Crime Branch officials arrested three persons and seized a live pangolin in Thane Police arrested four accused and recovered a live pangolin in December 2018 in Raigarh Pune police seized a live pangolin and four and a half kilogrammes of scales in two separate incidents in January 2019 Thane police seized 55 kg of scales and arrested three persons in June 2019 Madhya Pradesh Forest officials seized

February 2018 with six kilogrammes of scales being taken to Nepal Five Bhutanese were arrested in May 2019 with a dead pangolin In November 2019 police arrested five Bhutanese and recovered a live pangolin concealed in a biscuit carton Assam With authorities cracking down on rhino poachers pangolin smuggling surged in the state Pangolins dead or alive are trafficked to Yunnan province China via Myanmar The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau WCCB seized 10 live pangolins during 201619 in Assam and the adjoining states In June 2019 an undercover agent reportedly had succeeded in fixing up a deal with smugglers to buy a live pangolin Chennai Pangolin scales weighing 111 kg along with other contraband wildlife articles seized from a godown two persons arrested in February 2019 Bengaluru 10 seizures of scales and live pangolins in 2019 International Seizures in 2019 Singapore Three highvalue seizures were made of scales believed to have been extracted from roughly 50000 pangolins On April 3 2019 Singapore Customs seized 142 tons of scales packed in 230 bags and falsely labeled as frozen beef in a 12 m container The consignment had originated from Nigeria and was destined to Vietnam The next week Customs announced a seizure of 14 tons of scales from a single consignment falsely declared as Cassia seeds originating from Nigeria and destined to Vietnam The scales from two African species the whitebellied tree pangolin and giant ground pangolin were valued at a few million dollars in the international market In July 119 tons of scales were seized along with 88 tons of elephant ivory The container was labeled as timber and was destined to Vietnam from DR Congo The scales are assessed to have been harvested from 2000 giant ground pangolins Hong Kong In January 2019 Hong Kong Customs seized 83 tons of pangolin scales along with 1000 elephant tusks The scales were possibly from 13000 pangolins and valued at eight million dollars The shipping consignment was labeled as frozen beef from Nigeria to Vietnam The temperature of the container was kept low to obfuscate the smell of the scales For the first time organised network used a new modus operandi namely a process of solidification in which they used ice bags and frozen meat to hide the distinctive smell of the scales Malaysia Police recorded the biggest haul of contraband in February 2019 when they seized about 30 tons of pangolins and their scales in raids in major processing facilities factories and warehouses in the Borneo State of Sabah Eighteen boxes of frozen pangolins in refrigerated containers along with 572 frozen pangolins 61 live pangolins in cages and 361 kg of scales were seized proving that Sabah was a major transit point in the illegal trade of pangolins from Africa to Asia China In December 2019 Customs seized over 25 tons of scales in the eastern city of Wenzhou and detained 18 suspects Originating from Africa the scales were smuggled in batches into China from Busan in South Korea Considered the largest haul of contraband wildlife in recent years the modus operandi involved wrapping of scales in layers of ginger spices making them almost impossible to be detected during inspection Vietnam A major destination of the illegal trade it recorded huge seizures of scales throughout the year In March 2019 eight tons of scales were seized in the northern port of Hai Phong In May police seized 53 tons of scales hidden in a shipment from Nigeria The scales were stuffed in 151 sacks and bags of raw cashew nuts to avoid detection In June Vietnam police seized four tons of scales along with 35 tons of elephant ivory from a container at Hai Phong The scales had been stuffed inside steel barrels mixed with others containing tar to avoid detection In December Customs seized three containers from Nigeria that concealed 17 tons of scales falsely declared as highend lumber Africa The major source of brutal killing and organised smuggling recorded significant seizures of scales In January 2019 Uganda made a major seizure of pangolin scales and arrested two Vietnamese nationals Cameroon Police apprehended four traffickers in March and recovered huge quantities of scales believed to have been harvested from 3000 pangolins In January 2020 Customs in Nigeria seized a staggering 95 ton shipment of poached pangolins from an abandoned warehouse in Lagos roughly representing 10000 dead pangolins BK Sharma is a Senior Indian Police Service IPS officer of Odisha cadre with 34 years of distinguished service who has worked in CBI as SP and DIG and

and gentle animals spending most of the day in tree hollows or underground burrows and venturing out only to eat at night Widely hunted for the wildlife trade their major mode of difference curling up into a ball of armour is sadly ineffective against mans greed Photo courtesy Alfred Weidinger A s night envelops Indias Konkan coast its treecanopied hills transmogrify into a vibrant alternative universe With the setting sun its daytime inhabitants slip into slumber making way for a m\u00e9lange of interesting creatures that will rule the nocturne From behind the trunk of a withered old kinjal tree a short snout pokes out vigilantly It sniffs the silent night air for a few seconds before its owner steps out into plain view This nocturnal denizen is one of the most bizarre creatures to roam the forest floor Looking like a chimerical hybrid its most striking feature is the arrangement of rusttinted scales that cover its body This armoured forager is a pangolin reticent elusive and rare its existence is not known by many Ironically it is the worlds most trafficked mammal its numbers having been driven down to such alarming levels that it might go extinct before most people realise that this erent species of armadillo doppelg\u00e4ngers once inhabited our planet Dissecting the Pecularity Eight species of the pangolin exist the IUCN statuses of all eight range from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered The most threatened of them are the Asian species the Chinese pangolin Manis pentadactyla the Indian pangolin Manis crassicaudata the Sunda pangolin Manis javanica and the Philippine pangolin Manis culionensis The largest the giant ground pangolin Smutsia gigantea and the smallest the blackbellied pangolin Phataginus tetradactyla along with the whitebellied pangolin Phataginus tricuspis and Temmincks ground pangolin Smutsia temminckii constitute the four African species Pangolins are insectivores feasting on more than 20000 insects predominantly ants and termites each day Aptly called scaly anteaters they possess one of the most bizarre tongue types in the animal kingdom A pangolins tongue is muscular and sticky and is anchored at the base of its sternum When fully distended it can reach over 40 cm longer than the animal itself This powerful tool helps it probe deep inside insects nests to find its prey The pangolin however is quite fastidious about its diet there are fewer than 20 ant and termite species that they prefer to devour Along with insects they swallow stones and sand These help the toothless animals grind their meals much like what happens inside a birds gizzard Perhaps the most peculiar feature of the pangolin is the armour of keratinous scales that covers the dorsal part of its body from head to tail These constitute close to a fifth of its body weight and act as one of the most effective natural defence mechanisms seen in the animal kingdom When threatened a pangolin curls itself up into a ball the word pangolin comes from the Malay word penggulung which means one that rolls up exposing only its tough scales This has proven effective even against the dangerous swipes of lions and tigers Moreover it possesses special glands near the anus which secrete a malodorous fluid to keep predators at bay Welladapted as it is to survive in the wild it is unfortunate that neither its shieldlike scales nor its rapierlike tongue have protected the pangolin against the most vicious species to have ever roamed our planet man A pangolin forages the ground in the buffer zone of the TadobaAndhari Tiger Reserve Maharashtra Two species are found in India the Chinese pangolin Manis pentadactyla and the Indian pangolin Manis crassicaudata Photo courtesy Kamlesh Thakur On the Brink of Doom Fueled by superstition misinformation and a penchant for perverse profligacy a thriving market for trafficked pangolins has succeeded in driving this animal to near extinction The pangolins scales are falsely touted to be something of a panacea in traditional Chinese medicine a claim as scientifically unproven as that of the magical curative powers of the rhinos horn From assertions of exorcising demons to curing palsy shamans and pseudoscientists have created an insatiable demand for this animals scales causing the pangolins numbers to plummet Moreover pangolin bushmeat is considered a delicacy in the most opulent circles of China and Vietnam Recently 127 tonnes and 14 tonnes of pangolin scales were seized in Singapore and Hong Kong respectively This is by no means a oneoff haul In 2017 authorities seized 119 tonnes of pangolin scales from the port of Shenzen in China This likely came from over 30000 pangolins Pangolin poaching incidents in India may not be as dramatic but are de\u00efnitely alarming In 2016 123 kg of pangolin scales were recovered from a Burmese national in Mizoram India In 2018 officials apprehended a gang of seven who were smuggling a pangolin in a car across Eastern India The Konkan coast is a hotbed for pangolin poaching In 2015 44 kg of pangolin scales were seized near Chiplun while another stash of 12 kg was recovered in Dapoli In 2016 750 g of pangolin scales were seized when a house in Maharashtras Raigad district was raided In 2017 the Maharashtra police managed to capture three men in possession of a live pangolin They were apprehended in Sindhudurg and were on their way to sell the hapless animal at a bargain In March 2019 the Panvel range forest mobile squad acted on a tipoff and nabbed seven men off the MumbaiPune Expressway attempting to smuggle a dead pangolin inside a gunny bag A Ray of Hope Based in Chiplun amidst the hills of the Konkan the Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra SNM has been engaged in nature conservation through education and community participation since 1992 Besides indigenous turtles birds and small mammals the NGO has actively been involved in raising awareness and mobilising the local masses to conserve the pangolin Under the stewardship of Bhau Vishwas Katdare Sanctuary Asia Vol 36 No 10 October 2016 SNM has pushed the cause of nature conservation Some of the NGOs most successful projects include timely action to arrest smugglers of nests of the Indian Swiftlet in Vengurla Rocks and an initiative to protect olive Ridley turtles along 720 km of the Konkan coastline Bhau Katdare is also a member the IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group 20172020 Composed of the same keratinous protein found in human nails pangolin scales are falsely touted to have magical medicinal powers and are a staple in Chinese traditional medicine to stimulate maternal lactation and treat skin diseases Curbing this excessive and illogical demand is key to protecting the species Photo courtesy Kenneth C On a Mission to Save the Worlds Most Trafficked Mammal Two incidents that resulted in the confiscation of a total of 56 kg of pangolin scales in the Konkan triggered SNMs resolve to work towards the protection of this endangered mammal From 2016 SNM began actively being involved in the insitu conservation of the pangolin in the Konkan with the Forest Department via field surveys education awareness workshops and mobilisation of the nearby townsfolk So how do you chalk out a conservation strategy for a species so timorous that even in regions where it is densely populated sightings are a rarity The answer lies in a stealthtechnology based technique motion sensor triggered camera traps that surreptitiously record an animals activity in its natural habitat SNM adopted cameratrapping to study indigenous pangolin populations in the Konkan an ingenious method that resolves several snags at once It surpasses the limitations of traditional survey and datagathering methodologies which require abundant manpower and time In fact it obviates human intervention completely which is advantageous when studying a species as shy as the pangolin across habitats and over extended periods of time Since 2016 15 Cuddleback and Spypoint trail cameras have been set up in various districts in the Konkan to document the presence and activity of the Indian pangolin It is a testimony to the rarity and wariness of this animal that of the initial 600 camera days only three recorded pangolin activities a hitrate of 05 per cent However gradually more than 40 cameras were deployed at identified pangolin burrows In March 2019 SNM crossed 10000 camera days collecting 206 photographs and 90 videos of the pangolin in its natural habitat These records prove to be a critical source in understanding the feeding habits of the Indian pangolin and the characteristics of its habitat Scat analysis was also used for covert observation of the pangolins feeding patterns Samples of droppings were collected from various locations and dried and stored for identification With the help of Dr Himender Bharti an ant expert the scat samples were profiled to determine the dietary preferences ants and termites of the Indian pangolin Since 2016 the Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra has deployed around 40 camera traps in the Raigad Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg region Camera trap photos and videos as well as scat sample analyses provide the critical resources necessary to analyse pangolin populations in the region their behaviour and dietary preferences they are known to be picky eaters which will further enable the drafting of effective conservation strategies Photo courtesy Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra People Power A vital \u00efrst step of conservation is to create awareness And one cannot emphasise this enough for a species as elusive and lesserknown as the pangolin Several activities are being conducted in the villages adjoining pangolin habitats Incidentally in 20182019 twelve pangolins were rescued when the local community informed SNM and the Forest Department The animals were released back into their natural habitat in the wild Last mile penetration is achieved by gathering villagers for regular workshops with considerable support from the Forest and Police Departments In 2017 alone over 200 locals from 135 villages participated The workshops act as a medium to educate commoners about the existence and habits of the Indian pangolin sensitise them towards its grave status and chalk out districtlevel protection strategies The workshops also serve to keep a check on the illicit trade of pangolin scales Until now 955 villages and 2758 schools in the Ratnagiri district have been reached For widespread communication the NGO uses Akashwani the All India Radio to highlight pangolin conservation It also designed and released the Khawlu Indian pangolin mascot to raise awareness both nationally and globally SNM also collaborated with cinematographer Ajinkya Khadpekar to create a documentary about the species in the local language Banners and billboards with pictorial information about pangolins are also set up in the villages SNM is also particularly focused on reaching out to young adults Through activities like drawing competitions essaywriting contests it engages children and educates them about the Indian pangolin SNM also published and released a pictorial story book about the Indian pangolin written by Bhau Katdare in the local language This story was introduced as a chapter in the middleschool syllabus and has since reached 16 million students a number expected to be replicated annually In late February every year wildlife enthusiasts and conservation bodies around the globe come together united by a common cause pangolin conservation For the last four years SNM has been celebrating this day with rallies involving locals particularly school children A Pangolin Cricket Cup is organised with the winner receiving a large papierm\u00e2ch\u00e9 replica of a pangolin This is followed by a congregation in which the village head Sarpanch typically addresses villagers and promises conservation support The Forest Department and Police Department have been consistently participating in the World Pangolin Day Celebrations helping forge positive relations with the authorities and locals Alternative Livelihoods Examining employment opportunities in the povertystricken Konkan region provides a different perspective on pangolin trafficking A structured programme that provides alternative livelihoods can go a long way in checking the hunting of this animal Such programmes are established as community enterprises that focus on constructive employment options A classic example is the conversion of pangolin poachers to beekeepers and honey producers Largescale traffickers exploit the knowledge of the locals to scout for pangolins and use them as footsoldiers SNM established a scheme whereby these local experts are paid Rs 500 if they spot and inform the authorities about a hive of the Sateri honeybee Apis cerana indica in the wild Moreover local farmers and tribals expressing interest are adequately trained and provided with honeybee boxes to rear bees Leveraging the locals proficient knowledge of the surrounding jungle and its wildlife SNM trains them in hospitality and ecotourism thus encouraging them to start a sustainable business in the form of homestays and nature guide services Digital marketing tools to help grow their business are also provided An Appeal Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra is a muchneeded ray of hope for the pangolin It shows how a small group of extremely passionate people can even with limited resources make a marked difference to the natural ecosystem It is a classic example of how NGOs involved in nature conservation can further their cause by appealing to the ethos of indigenous populations thereby achieving muchneeded scale to create sustainable impact The plight of the pangolin affords an archetypal instance of human greed assuming perverse proportion If pangolin trafficking goes unchecked the planet will lose an extraordinary species depriving future generations of the chance to see these delightful creatures the only mammals with scales Protection of the Highest Order The pangolin is the most trafficked mammal in the world According to a 2016 report by the IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group it was estimated that between 20002013 alone over one million pangolins had been illegally trafficked across the globe principally for their scales and blood used in Chinese traditional medicine though not scienti\u00efcally proven and their meat considered an exclusivelyfortherich meal To protect the species from becoming extinct in 2016 the UN Convention on Illegal Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES the body that regulates the international wildlife trade banned the trade of all eight species of pangolin citing them under Appendix 1 the highest category of legal protection This meant a ban on any human use sale or possession of a pangolin alive or dead or any of its parts If anyone is caught they could be charged with a fine of up to US25000 and imprisonment of up to three years or both Reservoirs of Disease The novel coronavirus COVID 19 spread which has now become a global pandemic is the latest zoonotic disease that has spread to humans from wildlife Thought to have originated in bats it has possibly been transmitted to humans through a wild animal an intermediate host for the virus for sale at a wet market in Wuhan China Initial studies suggest that it could possibly be the pangolin as these scaly anteaters and several species of bats are often sold in wet markets allowing the spillover of pathogens between the species and therefore onward to humans who come in close contact This is not the first case of pandemic zoonotic diseases the SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2002 originated from the masked palm civet traded in China the avian influenza H5N1 outbreak in 2003 originated from Mountain Hawkeagles the ebola virus outbreak in 2013 originated from the trade of bats and nonhuman primates Reports suggest that at least 60 percent of emerging infectious diseases that affect humans are zoonotic and increasing rates of wildlife trafficking only makes the human population more susceptible to infections Kidnapping Across Borders The black market for pangolin trade is notoriously active across international borders through networks of organised crime syndicates According to reports by the Wildlife Justice Commission WJC between 20162019 there were about 52 seizures of pangolin scales weighing more than 500 kg With rapidly decreasing populations of Asian pangolin species due to poaching a significant growth in the trade of African pangolin species has been observed in the past few years with Nigeria at the epicentre The WJC identified the 27 countries involved with six of them responsible for 94 per cent of the overall contraband China Hong Kong Vietnam Singapore Nigeria and Democratic Republic of Congo International bodies such as the Interpol along with the World Customs Organisation WCO have organised raids and international surveillance of illegal trafficking in two recordbreaking seizures in April last year a 142tonne shipment and a 14tonne shipment of pangolin scales from an estimated 72000 pangolins were

2020 Dailong Village Manipur One of the central aims of the Stop Slaughtering Wildlife campaign by Sanctuary Nature Foundation and The Corbett Foundation has been to recognise grassroots conservationists and communities each of whom are contributing steadfastly to biodiversity conservation and community engagement to create awareness about the impact of degradation of habitats and the commercial trade of wildlife species Weve recognised four such villages and communities one of whom well tell you a little about in this update the Dailong village in Manipur Dailong is a picturesque village situated in Tamenglong district of Manipur around 150 km northwest of Imphal the states capital The entire landscape of Tamenglong is hilly with dense wet evergreen forests with extraordinary varieties of orchids ferns bamboo and other vegetation This type of landscape has the potential to harbour several threatened species of animals such as Hoolock Gibbon Serow and Clouded Leopard among others One would expect to see these forests teeming with faunal species as well but unfortunately very few remain in these forests due to the traditional hunting practices Dailong has around 230 families all Rongmei Nagas mostly practicing jhum cultivation for their subsistence The community members own large chunks of forests as is the case with most communities in the northeast A total of 1135 sqkm of forest owned by the village headman has been declared as a Biodiversity Heritage Site under Section 37 1 of Biological Diversity Act 2002 Photo courtesy The Corbett Foundation On ground Observations While nature worship sacred groves and conservation of natural resources have been at the heart of many ethnic groups of northeast India hunting as a tradition by the tribes in Tamenglong is a huge threat to the biodiversity Though the primary reason for the local communitys dependence on hunting has been reported to be a lack of economic alternatives In the absence of sustainable socioeconomic alternatives the dependence of villagers on the community forests continues to increase The tools used for guarding crops by the farmers are not conservationfriendly The traditional hunting practices and crop guarding practices like setting up traps and gunshots pose threats to the conservation of existing wildlife in the community forests Changes in the traditional practice of jhum cultivation have been adversely affecting the soil nutrients and soil fertility due to a decline in the cycle of shifting cultivation The villagers continue to extract firewood irrespective of them having LPG stoves This continuation of firewood collection from the forests further degrades the health of the forests Either the supply of LPG needs to be made more reliable or in the absence of it there is a need to introduce ecofriendly stoves along with encouraging people to grow their own fuelwood The Corbett Foundation working in the region has recognised the need to roll out initiatives that provide alternate livelihoods for the people depending on the forest for their needs One such option is to develop communitymanaged tourism that has a huge potential to attract nature enthusiasts to see the extraordinary forest of the region When this opportunity is utilised the collateral benefit will be biodiversity expansion because the people of Dailong will see this new venture as an additional and legitimate source of income for themselves Weve identified the scope of clubbing two activities To identify people who venture out in the forest to meet their daily needs and then train them to make a living by nature guiding beekeeping and other nonforest activities If five members of the local community are identified and incorporated in protecting the habitat this will send positive ripples of participation across the local community The face of our campaign in Manipur is the wonderful Mordecai Panmei Mordecai Panmet will be the ground coordinator for this village site Photo courtesy The Corbett Foundation Mordecai Panmei will be coordinating and executing the alternative income generation plans on the ground Mordecai belongs to the Rongmei tribe and is from Azuram

successfully tracked a seller down and rescued an injured and traumatised pangolin First Aid was then administered to the pangolin in consultation with the veterinarian at Keibul Lamjao National after which it was fed and kept under observation for two days The pangolin was released into the Azuram Community Reserve forest under the supervision of the RFO Range Forest Officer Kharibam Singh Your

life to change It did for Hans Dalal the talented and incredibly committed conservationist working in and for the forests of Tadoba through his NGO Preservation of Wild Landscapes PROWL that was started by him and his wife Avantika to promote humanwildlife coexistence and wildlife conservation in the fringe villages of the tiger reserve After spending five years in the music industry Hans launched his own music studio which he ran independently for five years Along with his work he would make annual pilgrimages to the Himalaya to trek and camp in what he describes as heaven On one such trip in Kanha in 2007 a fivesecond tiger sighting moved his soul and changed his life Within the year he shut his studio and moved to Ranthambhore where he met with the late Fateh Singh Rathore to learn about the striped cats and how he could be a part of the team that worked to save them The first task he was given was to meet the Moghiyas a traditional huntergatherer tribe that had turned to poaching to eke out a living Combining his sound engineering skill with his love for the wild he and a friend Sidd Cutto painstakingly shot a documentary titled With a Little Help in which he relied on the Moghiyas incredible musical talents The three lakh rupees they earned from the film was used by Fateh Singhs team to rejig the life of the fabled tribe away from hunting to protecting tigers That was just the beginning Hans then began to travel through forest after Indian forest to document their biodiversity and understand the complexities of humanwildlife interactions Today Hans has given up city life to settle on the periphery of the tiger forests of Tadoba Nothing has of course been easy Hans developed cerebral palsy soon after birth but went on to live a normal life With his typical wry sense of humour he asks with a chuckle What exactly is normal Everyone is abnormal in their own way Hans credits his parents for his successes in life as he goes about doing his bit to improve the lot of local communities and create linkages between them and the Maharashtra Forest Department Today PROWL conducts intimate training programmes for forest guards by familiarising them with camera trapping emergency first aid and the use of technology to monitor the movement of the tigers next to which they live He also helps the Forest Department staff in humananimal conflict situations And his wildlife documentaries not only capture the sheer beauty of Indias forests but also tell compelling stories on those working to protect them Hans is driven by tigers and the need to protect them Just one phone call from Sanctuary saw him heading for Umred where he helped Rohit Karoo the Honorary Wildlife Warden set up some of the first camera traps to monitor the tigers of this then virtually unknown forest His work also helped confirm that tigers were moving across humanmade boundaries between southern Maharashtra and northern Telangana He credits his passion to those first fiveseconds of a tiger sighting that cast a spell on him and hopes that others upon whom the tiger weaves its spell also turn their professions and talents to save the magnificent cat and its fabled

2020 Khaara Village Madhya Pradesh O ne of the central aims of the Stop Slaughtering Wildlife campaign has been to recognise grassroots conservationists and communities each of whom are contributing steadfastly to biodiversity conservation and community engagement to create awareness about the impact of degradation of habitats and the commercial trade of wildlife species Weve recognised four such villages and communities one of whom well tell you a little about in this update The corridor between Kanha and Pench Tiger Reserves popularly referred to as KanhaPench corridor KPC covers an area of approximately 16000 sq km It lies in three districts of Madhya Pradesh Balaghat Seoni and Mandla More than half of Balaghat district is covered with dense forest making it the district with the highest forest cover in the state of Madhya Pradesh These forests have presence of tigers leopards sloth bears dhole and hyena Jena et al 2011 The corridor is actively used by dispersing tigers Sharma et al 2013 and has been identified as a refuge for other mammals including the leopard dhole gaur sambar and chital Vattakavan 2010 Collection of NonTimber Forest Produce NTFP is one of the common income generation activities in this corridor with established market linkages in place for a number of products such as tendu leaves mahua flowers sal seeds and bamboo harvest Collection of these requires the local communities to venture into the forests for several kilometres increasing the chances of encounters with wild animals Other domestic activities such as grazing of cattle collection of fuelwood wood collection for building houses and bushmeat hunting also increase the risk of confronting wild animals Depredation of livestock by big cats and cropraiding by wild herbivores and wild pigs often result in retaliatory measures being adopted by the local communities The remoteness of these areas lack of primary healthcare inadequate connectivity with nearby cities and lack of easy access to developmental schemes has created an environment where local communities feel neglected from the main stream and thus are often made easy targets by the poaching mafia Unless these communities are provided with sustainable alternatives to earn livelihoods that are not dependent on the exploitation of forest resources the future of these communities and wildlife in these areas is bleak The Khaara village Khaara is one such village nestled in the dense forests of the Kanha Pench Corridor in South Balaghat Forest Division It is a small village of around 25 households of the Gond community The village is 25 km off BalaghatLaugur Road which is accessible through mud road that passes through beautiful and dense forest which as good as the core zone of Kanha Tiger Reserve Gaur fourhorned antelope barking deer sambar are seen in good numbers clearly indicating its potential as a tiger habitat Khaara villagers only practice paddy cultivation in the meagre land they own This crop is prone to crop raiding as the village is entirely surrounded by forests on all four sides However this disadvantage can be turned into an advantage by promoting a communitymanaged tourism venture The village has a lot of enthusiastic youth The Corbett Foundation runs its medical programme in this village and other five villages in its vicinity and have often discussed this option with them The good news is that this community has shown interest in being a part of this venture This village has the potential to be a model of responsible wildlife tourism that is managed entirely by the local youth women and men in collaboration with the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department There will be a host of various livelihood trainings imparted to these youth that will help them earn sustainably through the year We have appointed Dikesh Chaudhary Project Officer Sustainable Livelihoods Kanha with The Corbett Foundation as the campaign coordinator in the Khaara Village He has a

t was just a palmsized baby in four months it has grown to almost half a metre now Baba informs me using his amputated forearm as a reference to the size Donning a scarlet kurta with a mustardcoloured lungi and a pair of hawaai chappals that are about to give up Sitaram Das aka Baba leads me to a mugger Crocodylus palustris which is reportedly basking in a paddy field Baba s looks can be deceiving as theres more to what meets the eye He can be a Baba and a soughtafter naturalist in a matter of sentences Baba has become synonymous with the natural habitat of Kotmi Sonar for devoting his life to the welfare of its resident mugger crocodiles Weve been in the fields for hours now but theres no trace of the mugger yet While Baba strides forward with ease I struggle to keep up It is a lethargic animal that gets tired easily and sometimes it takes days to move he quips indicating that we may be moments away from finding it Six months ago during the summers a female mugger had laid around 20 eggs It takes about two months for the eggs to hatch he adds During our conversation Baba casually passes on a great deal of species specific behavioural and nesting observations The knowledge attained in the wild through many years of observation would perhaps impress the likes of John Thorbjarnarson even more Inquisitive as I was I asked about the people who were specially trained a few years ago to perform this task I dont know perhaps theyve been trained to be scared he jokes We are in the Kotmi Sonar village of Chhattisgarh in the JanjgirChampa district 150 km northeast of the state capital Raipur Kot means a fort and sonar is a goldsmith Since there exists a plethora of Kotmi villages in Chhattisgarh the suffix sonar was attached to distinguish this village more so because the influential family here were goldsmiths The Kotmi Sonar Fort as referred to in ancient scriptures is a Mrid durg Mud Fort identifiable by mud ramparts Pr\u00c4k\u00c4r surrounded by a ditch Parikh\u00c4 It is now in ruins Its magnanimity and historical significance can be estimated through its physical features and archaeological findings suggest that the fort is around 2500 years old Baba has become synonymous with the natural habitat of Kotmi Sonar for devoting his life to the welfare of its resident mugger crocodiles Protecting Crocodiles A Parallel Crocodilian science is relatively new with studies dating back nearly 300 years Barring the two species namely the New Guinea crocodile and the Philippine crocodile that were described in 1928 and 1935 respectively all known crocodile species were described between 17581828 However our associations with crocodiles are well reflected in mythology and folklore which provides us with a deeper sense of association with the reptiles Mugger or makara in Hindu mythology is the vehicle of the river goddesses Ganga and Narmada With their motionless vigilance and revered mystical powers the crocodiles provided the Kotmi Fort with an added layer of defense and in return the muggers had a suitable habitat in the moat that surrounds the fort Intruders had to cross the Parikh\u00c4 to reach the Pr\u00c4k\u00c4r Needless to say no one dared to In 1961 British Zoologist Hugh B Cott first drew the attention of the scientific community towards the need for crocodilian conservation Around the same time a 25yearold Sitaram Das came to Kotmi from Uttar Pradesh Leaving behind the responsibilities of family life he began residing in the Ram temple adjacent to the Jogia talab Over the years Baba became familiar with the natural habitat around him and soon discovered that Jogia talab was a nesting site for the muggers As there are various ponds around this area it is ideal for muggers to live in and in particular the Lilagar river a tributary of Shivnath flowing by the village completes their habitat requirement explains Baba Wetland estimate studies still reflect the JanjgirChampa district with the highest wetland area in Chhattisgarh A Google Earth view of the mud rampart and its surrounding moat adjoining Kotmi Sonar village Worldwide concern for crocodile conservation gathered pace in 1971 when the IUCN created a CrocodileSpecialist Group chaired by Hugh B Cott India responded with the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 which extended protection to all three of its crocodile species plus a host of other plants and animals By 1976 the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust had been established by Zai and Romulus Whitaker to safeguard crocodiles All this while other developments were also taking place in the central Indian region of Kotmi Sonar where Baba was protecting crocodiles and their habitats According to Baba serving Lord Ram meant serving the creatures around us Jogia talab was gradually turned into a monitored relatively safe hatchery for muggers The world was of course totally unaware of Baba and he the world Usually they do not require any special care but some farmers give them a lift to the waterbody Muggers make their landwater movements early in the morning here When farmers start before dawn to prepare the field for sowing they tilt their buffalo carts to act as a ramp for a mugger to climb up On reaching the waterbody the cart is tilted again to allow the muggers to slide out into the waterbody Baba narrates this with childlike joy in his eyes In Kotmi there have been only a few stray instances of mishaps involving muggers and humans Death Wish After the failed attempt of finding the mugger in the field we return to his home the Ram temple Baba points towards the three ponds adjoining the fields and concludes that it could have walked into any one of them At the temple he serves me with cows milk and I let the naturalist in him expound on the muggers in the area They love eating fish Turtles are also relished and I have also seen them eating babies of other crocodiles For nesting they dig burrows in soft mud by the ponds in summer Once the rains arrive the thunder and lightning assist in cracking the eggs open Modern crocodilian science may discard this observation but The lost hero of science Alexander Von Humboldt surely would have conducted an experiment to test this Baba has been shifting the juveniles to the bigger ponds safely year after year They are all my children he adds Muda Talab in the JanjgirChampa district of Chhattisgarh harbours a sizeable mugger population and has become increasingly popular with tourists By 1989 we were celebrating the increase in the population of crocodiles in India and at the same time Whitaker highlighted the importance of ameliorating the locals fears and he began educating them about conservation It was becoming increasingly difficult in many areas to release crocodiles because of opposition from locals who were unfamiliar and afraid of muggers Jogia talab by then had begun witnessing an increase in the number of visitors and Baba used the opportunity to enlighten children and locals about the muggers in their village He began entertaining visitors and villagers by speaking about mugger behaviour so that their nesting period would be respected Baba had little idea about the global conservation imperatives and still has little idea of the global concern for the reptilians At a time when crocodilian conservation was moving towards population biology captive management and husbandry Baba was implementing his own brand of conservation through ecological associations that involved no cost at all and were not part of any project apart from his lifestyle I guess it would not be completely accurate to state that there was no cost incurred On April 1 2006 Baba chased some kids who were harassing an incubating female mugger Unaware of just how close he had approached the mugger a sudden lunge and a jawclap left Babas forearm badly tattered and torn Laughing loudly he recollected the incident saying I thought I had been called back by Ram but when I realised I was alive I understood that my services were still required But you did not feel angry I asked Momentarily yes but it was a misunderstanding They are very sensitive while incubating eggs he clarifies This incident led to the Forest Department laying the foundation stone for the Crocodile Park on May 9 2006 which was inaugurated on August 23 2008 Supported by a rich history suitable habitat and a fulltime naturalist the creation of a crocodile park in Kotmi was only natural The only consolidated checklist of 45 species of reptiles under 29 genera of 11 families from Chhattisgarh was published in 2005 Surprisingly Crocodylus palustris was not included on the list despite its obvious presence for reasons yet unknown Allaying the fears of locals living with the muggers and educating them on their critical service to water bodies helped foster coexistence Thirteen years since the fateful day of Baba s interaction with the croc his lifestyle remains unchanged He continues to protect and nurture muggers in the area safeguarding their habitat monitoring their breeding and assisting juveniles to safely negotiate their landwater movements Often when visitors fail to sight a mugger Baba makes a distinct Aao aao come come call to which the muggers respond by showing up near the banks of the pond You have dedicated your life to serving these Rams what next now I ask With his eyes still set at the paddy fields scanning for the kid he responds as if narrating his will Bas jab mai maru to mujhe inhe hi khila dena not a lot when I die just feed me to them Since 1989 the concerted conversation efforts of several organizations such as The Crocodile Bank and individuals such as Baba have enabled muggers to make a comeback in India Statue of Unity Unlike in Kotmi Sonar no crocodile savior has been able to stop the displacement of crocodiles in two waterbodies Pachmuli lake and Khalvani lake near the Statue of Unity in Gujarats Narmada district Several Indian crocodiles or muggers were lured into cages using fish bait and transported via pickup trucks possibly to the reservoir of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam Dr Jitendra Gavali Director Community Science Centre Vadodara expressed his concern to DailyO saying the transfer of reptiles in such large numbers for making a seaplane terminal are against the principles of the Wildlife Protection Act He also warned that if the slope of the dam was more than 40 degrees female crocodiles would not be able to nest A whole slew of other issues also come into play No carryingcapacity study has been undertaken of the new site or efforts made to take cognizance of the behaviour of the crocodiles India muggers are territorial animals and introducing so many animals into a reservoir could result in territorial fights

heard gunshots in the middle of the night It was one of his first nights at the camp A forest guard with Maharashtras Special Tiger Protection Force posted at the Pench Tiger Reserve he was recently assigned additional charge of a beat that abutted the Madhya Pradesh border The beat had all the problems that a forest guard can worry over grazing treefelling and poaching of deer and wild pigs with bharmaar bandook a crude locally made shotgun that fires a mix of gunpowder and shrapnel He braced himself for the inevitable and waited for sunrise Forest guards at work This workforce toils endlessly around the clock often poorly equipped or trained and little appreciated to keep our forests and wildlife safe What we see here is a badlyneeded health assessment so crucial to the effective implementation of their very tough duties Photo Dr Anish Andheria The next morning Shendre and his two assistants the forest watchers assigned to him headed in the direction of the state border Walking a narrow foresttrail they heard a gunshot again They followed the trail of the sound and came facetoface with two men each carrying a gun His assistants started closing in on them from the sides while Shendre approached from the centre The men sprang up and began running Shendre was about to apprehend the man lagging behind when the man turned and pointed the gun at him I had raised my hands in surrender yet he fired at me he says A shrapnel pierced his collarbone and he fell on his side bleeding No vehicle could have reached the spot as it was down a valley The watchers informed the nearest Round Office on the wireless system and started carrying him by the shoulders They clambered up and down the hill for two kilometres to reach the nearest camp A car then transported Shendre to a dispensary in the nearest town and then to a hospital in Nagpur where he received intensive care for 15 days Satish Shendre a forest guard with Maharashtras Special Tiger Protection Force

out on foot patrols put their lives on the line every day and even after they make the ultimate sacrifice most remain unsung their names often appearing in the rolls of honour as Raju India or Unnamed India A firstofitskind health needs assessment of forest guards working in tiger reserves in Central India conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Trust WCT with technical support from the Tulsi Foundation UK has thrown light on their exposure to medical emergencies access to medical equipment and first aid training and the availability of healthcare facilities The study is the largest of its kind and its findings are the fruit of three years of exhaustive field surveys that covered over 1200 forest guards from 14 tiger reserves across five states India ranks first in onduty mortality of frontline forest staff Between 2012 and 2017 India accounted for almost a third 162 of 520 of all ranger frontline forest staff deaths according to the International Ranger Federation According to the study the median distance that forest guards have to travel to seek definitive care treatment required to conclusively manage a medical condition for major health emergencies like fits and seizures serious injuries animal attacks poacher assaults major accidents heart attacks and cardiac arrests was over 30 km As many as 32 per cent of the forest guards reported that that they had no access to local medical facilities whatsoever within commuting distance five kilometres or less These numbers have inspired WCT to take the next logical step in partnership with the Forest Department a mapping study of health facilities around tiger reserves in Central India The exercise will help understand where health infrastructure exists where it doesnt and how existing infrastructure can be supported

equipment A startling 82 per cent of forest guards revealed that they had no access to medical first aid in the field Visits to antipoaching camps also revealed an abysmal lack of first aid items and equipment While the top three items the guards had access to in the field were simple pain killers 145 per cent bandages 128 per cent and antiseptics 109 per cent very few guards had splints 13 per cent stretchers 09 per cent and thermometers 32 per cent Dr Chet Trivedy of the Tulsi Foundation who serves as WCTs Chief Medical Officer says Although it might be difficult to equip all forest guards with a full medical kit basic items such as bandages dressings and tourniquets which are lifesaving should be accessible in emergencies Practical training and educational resources should also be provided so that they can manage medical emergencies with confidence A disappointing 64 per cent of all participants had never received any first aid training The remainder had received varying degrees of training from informal to basic and advanced The importance of training forest guards in first aid and trauma management cannot be overstated The right skill or the lack of it can make all the difference in an emergency situation In case of a vehicular accident or a fall from a height protecting the spine and binding the pelvis while extricating the victim could prevent further injury or death The technique called logrolling is just one of the many skills imparted to forest guards during the Trauma Management Training sessions we held The training programme was introduced in February 2016 Over 1200 forest guards from 15 tiger reserves and two wildlife sanctuaries from Central India have thus far been trained in a collaborative effort with Forest Departments Attendees at a Trauma Management Training programme held in collaboration with the Tulsi Foundation in February 2016 Photo Wildlife Conservation Trust The skills and techniques imparted adhere to the latest prehospital care standards If one considers the management of snakebites most traditional methods of first aid are either useless harmful or even potentially dangerous While conducting surveys for the study Dr Vishal Gadre Programme Officer with WCTs Health team was horrified to learn that an elderly forest guard had chopped off the finger of a snakebite victim believing that would prevent the venom from spreading On the other hand forest staff that have undergone trauma training have been able to help victims in a much safer and scientific manner During the monsoon of 2018 Jagdeep Manohare a data entry operator employed with the Melghat Tiger Reserve was downloading patrolling tracks on his laptop at one of the field headquarters when a wireless message informed him that a forest watcher had been bitten by a snake nine kilometres away Manohare had undergone training in trauma management and remembered the first aid treatment for snakebites He rode his bike through gushing streams and tall grass while it rained and reached the spot He immediately calmed the victim and inspected the bite marks near his ankle The victims companion had tied a handkerchief a little above the wound around the shin hoping that it would prevent the venom from spreading up his leg But Manohare had learnt the most effective pressure bandaging method during the training Improvising with whatever material was available he made a pressure pad with his own handkerchief placed it directly on the site of the bite and wrapped the other handkerchief tightly over it He then ferried the victim on his bike to a fourwheeler engaging and reassuring the victim the whole way to prevent him from losing consciousness The victim was then taken to the nearest hospital where he was stabilised and discharged soon Emergencies like these are not uncommon in the field Fiftyfour per cent of participating forest guards had faced some medical emergency in the field and 30 per cent had contracted malaria Forest guards safeguard our critical natural resources that provide ecosystem services beyond any monetary value Yet they have to face safety and health risks that are to a good extent abatable with appropriate interventions As we celebrate the rise in Indias tiger numbers a good proportion of which live outside Protected Areas and come in contact with humans the urgent need is to

photographs by Dr Seshadri KS A tadpole of the Microhyla sp in a pool of water in the Kathlekan region of Karnataka Microhyla ornata tadpoles are especially sensitive to pollutants in the water T hese foul and loathsome animals are abhorrent because of their cold body pale colour cartilaginous skeleton filthy skin fierce aspect calculating eye offensive smell harsh voice squalid habitation and terrible venom wrote the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th Volume of his magnum opus Systema Naturae published in 1758 Over three centuries later is our perception of amphibians any better Unfortunately amphibians continue to be largely held in contempt eliciting responses such as ewww yuck and rarely so cute A root cause for such disgust could be our bias and collective ignorance Amphibians get their name from two Greek words amphi and bios which indicate the dual lifestyle typical of most amphibians wherein aquatic tadpoleslarvae metamorphose into terrestrial adults Amphibians are distributed globally except at the frozen poles highaltitude mountain peaks and dry deserts They constitute three major groups Anura those lacking a tail frogs and toads Gymnophiona those that possess a naked serpentine characteristic caecilians and Caudata those with a prominent tail salamanders and newts Primitive Origins Amphibians are among the earliest vertebrates to have walked on land They evolved from aquatic ancestors and colonised the earth around 360 million years ago Mya The earliest known ancestor to the modernday frog is a fossil identified as Triadobatrachus massinoti which roamed the earth during the early Triassic period 250 Mya in the landmass we now call Madagascar The earliest caecilian ancestor does not show up in fossil records for until another 50 Mya during the early Jurassic period 200175 Mya The caecilian Eocaecilia micropodia was discovered in present day Arizona Another 50 million years elapsed until the earliest ancestor of salamanders appeared in fossil records during the late Jurassic period 157 Mya It was dug up in presentday China and is known as Beiyanerpeton jianpingensis During the subsequent millennia several mass extinction events wiped out of a large number vertebrates and yet some primitive amphibians survived giving rise to modernday amphibians Among Anurans species diversification is believed to have occurred most rapidly during the CretaceousPaleogene mass extinction event which incidentally wiped out nonavian dinosaurs around 66 Mya Researchers postulate that there was an ecological release wherein vegetation began to recover after a mass extinction and myriad frog species evolved rapidly to colonise the empty habitats The fact that several arboreal frog lineages evolved around this time lends credence to this hypothesis The caecilian Ichthyophis bombayensis has distinct eyes surrounded by light rings unlike most of its group which are eyeless and thus blind A tadpole of the Malayan horned frog Megophrys nasuta The placement of the mouth reveals that the species is a surface feeder Astounding Diversity Globally there are approximately 8074 species of amphibians with Anurans comprising 88 per cent 7124 species followed by Caudata nine per cent 737 species and Gymnophiona three per cent 213 species Amphibian diversity is second only to birds 9000 species and far greater than all mammals 5400 species The smallest of them a frog Paedophryne amauensis is found in the remote jungles of Papua New Guinea Measuring just short of eight millimetres from snout to vent the frog is also considered to be the smallest vertebrate The largest amphibian is the Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus It often grows to lengths of up to 15 m and can weigh up to 50 kg Despite the stark contrast all three groups of amphibians share several similarities but are distinct in appearance A common characteristic of all amphibians is their semipermeable moist skin which helps them breathe Another is the presence of antimicrobial peptides on their perpetually moist skin which protects against infections They also possess toxinproducing glands that shield them from predators The typical body plan of adult frogs and toads consists of a head attached to the trunk without a neck the trunk is small with up to nine vertebrae and an elongated pelvic bone giving them a sloping back Their hind limbs are generally longer than forelimbs They possess four fingers and five toes They lack calcified teeth some having toothed projections called vomerine teeth Many frogs and toads have a large tympanum used for hearing and males possess vocal sacs Anurans have evolved incredible features that give them a curious agility Their fingers and toes have segments making them flexible and enabling them to hop long distances and climb slippery surfaces Their ability to cling on to leaves is owed to adhesive disks on their digits They are also able to effortlessly glide with the help of webbing between digits of hands and feet Salamanders are lizardlike in appearance The head is proportionate to the body and the tail is as long as the head and torso combined The torso has up to 22 vertebrae and two pairs of legs of equal length with four fingers and five toes When cornered by a predator some salamanders cut off their tail which wriggles around to distract the predator while the individual escapes and regrows the tail Caecilians are perhaps the most distinct of all amphibians Lacking limbs they look like large worms Their cylindrical body is marked by annular rings and in most cases has no distinct tail The head is small and blunt and is the same diameter as the torso which has over 100 vertebrae The head has a pair of eyes which are reduced in size compared to the body The mouth is large containing several toothed projections and a pair of tentacles on either side located between the nostril and the jaw It is a chemosensory organ which can be flicked in and out helping them sense their way underground While most species are fossorial a few are known to be aquatic Our knowledge and understanding of amphibians are limited compared to that of other vertebrates While frogs toads salamanders and newts are relatively well studied very little is known about caecilians A Matang narrowmouthed frog tadpole Microhyla borneensis rests inside a pitcher plant apparently immune to the liquid it produces to dissolve insects The Great Colonisers The three groups are distributed in remarkably different ways Anurans are widespread decreasing in diversity towards the north pole and increasing towards the south pole but absent at both poles Their greatest diversity is present at the equator and around the tropics salamanders are predominant in the northern hemisphere with a few species reaching south of the equator in South America and Caecilians are restricted to the equator Specifically most Anuran species are found in the lowland rainforests of South America Central Africa Madagascar Western Ghats of India Southeast Asia Oceania and Eastern Australia Salamanders thrive most on the West Coast in the Eastern United States Europe and parts of Asia Caecilians are predominant in the lowland rainforests of South America the Ivory Coast in Africa the Western Ghats of India and across Southeast Asia This disjunctive distribution is probably a synergistic result of their historical origins continental drift ecology and presentday climate Understanding the distribution pattern of amphibians however continues to be an unresolved puzzle in biogeography Even regionally the distribution of amphibians varies For example amphibiaweborg lists 435 species found India with 394 frogs and toads 39 caecilians and two salamanders Over 80 per cent of these species are endemic to the Western Ghats and both salamanders are endemic to the Himalaya In India there are three global biodiversity hotspots the Western Ghats northeast India and the Andaman Islands Incidentally each of these areas is renowned for endemic amphibians Hidden in Plain Sight Euphlyctis karaavali and Microhyla laterite Two species of frogs were discovered on the outskirts of the Western Ghats in the midst of human settlements in 2016 Both were likely confused to be their close relatives who are common and widespread In the town of Manipal near Udupi in Karnataka Ramit Singal an engineer by training encountered a frog belonging to the genus Microhyla A few hundred kilometres away CR Naik a forester encountered another frog and asked us to identify it We listened to the call and brushed it off as the call of a Whitethroated Kingfisher He persisted and got a video the next night and we were spellbound it was a skittering frog of the genus Euphlyctis Using the call morphology and genetic samples we were able to determine that they were indeed different species and named one as Microhyla laterite after the fast disappearing laterite rock formations and the other as Euphlyctis karaavali after the Kannada name for the coastal region where the frog was restricted Both the species are already threatened by rampant habitat loss The discoveries highlight the fact that one only needs to pay careful attention to what is around them and many species may be waiting to be discovered Euphlyctis karaavali Microhyla laterite Exceptional Ecology Amphibians are an important component of the ecosystem They primarily feed on invertebrates such as insects many of which we consider to be pests and unbeknown to us keep their population under check Being primary consumers they are an important source of nutrition to other organisms in the food chain Amphibians are consumed by predators such as birds snakes and small mammals It is very likely that in any given area the highest numbers of vertebrates excluding humans are going to be amphibians because of their abundance and commonness they are found right in the middle of cities to remote jungles even on farflung islands It is likely that the most common encounter of amphibians to most of us is the incessant chorus of frogs on a rainy night Anurans communicate primarily by sound where the males call to attract the females Salamanders and caecilians communicate with chemical cues The reproductive behaviour of amphibians is one of the most intricate aspects of amphibian biology They evolved from aquatic ancestors and despite having colonised terrestrial habitats they seem unable to break their connection with water as many of them return to water to breed Several groups of frogs have indeed been able to move away from water that they no longer require any freeflowing water to breed Such an adaptation is called Direct Development which has so far been observed in over half of all amphibians In this adaptation amphibians deposit eggs in terrestrial habitats such as in moss on leaves or under leaf litter The embryo develops within the translucent eggs and a juvenile amphibian emerges In the Western Ghats for example all species of the genus Raorchestes are believed to undergo direct development and some like the bamboo breeding frog Raorchestes chalazodes provide intensive parental care to the offspring Sanctuary Asia Vol 38 No 12 December 2018 The diversity of reproductive behaviour of amphibians brings into question the validity of the notion of dual life upon which amphibians are classified There are thousands of species for which the traditional egg to tadpole to adult transformation is not the norm and as we learn more we realise that exceptions are in fact a rule in biology Some frogs such as this adult Ghatophryne ornata often flip over to play dead to startle predators by displaying their vibrantly coloured underbelly This behaviour is called the Unken Reflex The rainbow toad Ansonia latidisca spotted in Sarawak Borneo in 2011 for the first time in nearly a century Roads Roadkills and Barriers to Movement India has one of the highest density of roads and other linear intrusions in the world second only to the United States Roads railway lines and power lines continue to bisect natural habitats Amphibians move to and away from breeding resources such as streams and ponds They often get crushed by speeding vehicles when they have to cross a road Several thousand gravid female frogs and Caecilians get run over by vehicles annually Roads are also barriers for dispersal For example the tadpoles of an endemic genus of frogs Indirana breed in a thin film of flowing water over rocks and boulders The tadpoles develop hind legs first and hop out moving terrestrially Road surfaces alter the natural flow of water increase water depth in puddles along the road and prevent the movement of tiny tadpoles The tadpoles are thus unable to disperse and risk facing immense competition for resources Lack of dispersal affects gene flow and as a result populations are at risk of local extinction Stopping night time traffic on roads through sensitive areas preventing road expansion creating underpasses for movement of frogs and educating motorists are some options to reduce the impact of roads on amphibians A roadkill of a gravid female Amboli bush frog Pseudophilautus amboli In Dire Straits Over the last decade there has been a sharp increase in the discovery of amphibians globally In India alone over 150 species of amphibians have been described from the year 2010 onwards at the rate of nearly three species every week While some of these discoveries are a result of stabilising taxonomy and separating cryptic species lumped into one group many are discoveries of frogs that had been hidden in plain sight read Hidden in Plain Sight below Despite these discoveries the amount of knowledge of each species continues to remain inadequate According to the IUCN Red List assessment made in 2004 the populations of 43 per cent of amphibians were on the decline and seven per cent of amphibians faced the risk of extinction The threat status of nearly 5800 species was left out because there was so little information about them Subsequent studies using statistical approaches predict that over half of the amphibians in the Not Assessed category would likely be Critically Endangered when formally assessed Amphibians are sensitive to environmental changes and are reeling under pressures created by anthropogenic activities which result in perturbations to habitat temperature regime and rainfall The indiscriminate use of pesticides increasing UVB radiation spreading of infectious diseases and expanding linear intrusions read Roads Roadkills and Barriers to Movement below have deepened the impact These perturbations have synergistic lethal effects Several amphibians such as the Chinese giant salamander are extremely rare in the wild because they are a local delicacy and are thus hunted With constant changes in global climate frogs are certainly affected On comparing measurements of museum specimens over time researchers have found that increasing global temperatures have led to a reduction in the body size of frogs Such impacts will have devastating cascading effects on the ecosystem One of the most widespread threats to amphibian populations is the deadly fungal disease Chytridiomycosis caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis The fungal spores spread through the environment and cause lesions on Anurans and they eventually die of heart failure Two species of Australian gastricbrooding frogs went extinct in the 1980s The Panamanian golden frog Atelopus zeteki nearly went extinct in the wild in 2007 In both cases it was the fungal disease which posed a threat Recent genetic studies have revealed that the fungus originated in East Asia and spread to other parts of the world likely via the illegal pet trade Native frogs are resistant to the local strain but not to the alien strain So far the only effective measure against this deadly pathogen is to not handle frogs wash all field gear in potassium permanganate solution and in extreme cases transfer the entire population to a captive breeding facility and reintroduce them once a solution to control the pathogen has been figured out Unfortunately a new species of the deadly fungus B salamandrivorans was discovered recently in salamanders As yet it only affects salamanders and is restricted to a small part of Europe where it will likely remain contained One thing thats certain however is that the future of amphibians is uncertain In the crystal clear waters of the Kinabalu Mountains of Borneo we see a brightlycoloured cluster of Meristogenys kinabaluensis tadpoles A Lost Cause One would find it ironic that amphibians that survived several mass extinctions during their 360 Mya journey into the present are going extinct today Amphibians are important culturally there are references to them in the Rig Vedas and proverbs they provide us with the free service of pest control and are aesthetically pleasing Conserving them is certainly not a lost cause and the first step is to increase awareness of people and acknowledge that there is a problem We are currently in the midst of a sixth mass extinction and the time period following the 20th century is known as the Anthropocene the era of human domination We have the power to change things for the worse or for the better Participating in educational programmes cutting across age groups see box on this page producing accessible field guides especially in local languages collecting long term ecological data to detect population fluctuations saying no to frog delicacies not handling them for photography lobbying for habitat protection and creating frogfriendly habitats outside of national parks and sanctuaries are some of the ways in which we could help make a better world for amphibians This is an excellent opportunity to change Linnaeuss perception that amphibians are foul and loathsome creatures In fact they are everything but that We ought to let them hop walk or crawl a little bit closer into our hearts to ensure their survival This fiercelooking pair in amplexus mating position are Malayan horned frogs Megophrys nasuta As with most frogs males are much smaller in size than females whose backs they mount as the latter go in search of suitable spots to lay their eggs Frogwatching With the advent of cameras we live in a world of shoot first and ask later While there is nothing wrong with it photographs can be misleading to identify amphibians Detailed notes are indispensable as they bring us closer to the organism we are observing How does one go about watching frogs To encourage frog enthusiasts my colleagues and I have been involved in various efforts to popularise frogwatching Watching amphibians is similar to watching birds First we locate them either by movement or by its call Then we carefully observe its features make a field sketch take detailed notes and refer to field guides There are several workshops on amphibians that are held across India these are typically open to anyone and charge a nominal fee The Bisle FrogWatch started by a group of nature enthusiasts is one such opportunity Every monsoon about 30 people gather in the sleepy town of Bisle in Karnataka to learn about amphibians Classroom sessions are followed by field sessions Cameras and handling of any frogs are strictly prohibited Participants make detailed sketches which we use for identification with the help of field guides and taxonomic descriptions The seventh

the Sundarbans landscape to reduce their direct dependence on the mangrove forests a centuriesold stronghold for the Bengal tiger T he correlation between a cyclone and its damaging effect on the mangrove forests in Sundarbans cannot be explained in a linear outline Cyclone Amphan the most lethal cyclone in the history of Bengal has changed the profile of riverine landscape of many villages across the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve STR The Joint Forest Management of the STR runs the primary tiger conservation efforts in the region Millions living in the fringe villages have grown to trust the field staff who are prompt in coming to their aid in the time of a crisis be it large or trivial However due to the remoteness and fragility of the landscape it is impossible for the staff to win over the entire fringe population singlehandedly The Society for Heritage and Ecological Researches SHER has always believed that without winning over the fundamental stakeholders of this unique bionetwork conservation efforts remain unsuccessful The primary occupations of these communities are rainfed agriculture and fishing Agriculture being a seasonal source of income has suffered a major setback by the devastation caused by the cyclone while fishing puts massive pressure on forest resources Photo courtesy Society for Heritage and Ecological Researches SHER has been providing distressed communities with relief supplies and medical assistance at ground zero since the very day after Amphan struck The Society has been working resolutely towards its objective to mitigate humanwildlife

the delta leading to an escalation in the dependence on forest resources and thus heightening conflict between the fishers and tigers STR issues Boat Licence Certificates to fishermen for fishing in a sustainable manner outside restricted forest areas These fishermen who generally set out in groups of more than five often spend days at a stretch fishing in the mangroves forest During this time they make use of traditional earthen stoves inside their boat to cook meals These stoves run on dry firewood which is hard to come by due to the humid microclimate of the Sundarbans The fishermen are left with no choice but to anchor their boat near mudflats and enter the forest to fetch firewood thus making them vulnerable to humantiger conflict Tigers have been recorded attacking people frequently when their territory is encroached upon However there is little knowledge of the number of tigers that get injured or the extent of their fatalities in such situations SHER provides portable LPG cylinders to licensed fishermen that are identified by STR so that they can refrain from venturing into tiger habitat Around 100 fishermen out of 600 that are licensed have been provided cylinders by SHER which also include a customised metal case for stability on turbulent rivers On August 7 2020 the first lot of LPG cylinders were distributed to fishermen from Bagna and Jhingakhali range at

May 27 2016 a forest beat officer found the carcass of a tigress in the Chikhaldara Range of the Gugamal Wildlife Division in the Melghat Tiger Reserve MTR Maharashtra He informed us and we immediately set off to the site along with Amlendu Pathak an IFS probation officer A subsequent postmortem revealed that the tigress was around eight to 10 years old with a full stomach that ruled out starvation as the cause and no signs of injury The tigress was later on identified as T15 thanks to photographic records The stomach viscera were carefully collected and immediately sent for toxicological analysis to Nagpur to check for poisoning The team was quite worried since only 10 days prior a male tiger had been reported dead in the same range After the tigresss parts had been collected for further investigation her body was burnt Shortly after a female tiger cub no more than three to four months old was discovered not too far from the site We decided to keep the news of the sighting confidential Camera traps were installed at ten chosen spots around the site including in the cave and surrounding areas Their footage was monitored daily by the Special Tiger Protection Force STPF staff which consisted of local men and women who had attended six months of training and knew the terrain like the back of their hands Since tiger cubs cannot fend for themselves at such a young age chicken meat was placed in the cave with the hope that the cub would return in search of the mother and find the food We grew increasingly worried when the cub did not show up at the site for the next three days Then on June 31 the camera traps finally captured footage of the cub venturing into the cave The next challenge was to provide support to the cub and ensure its protection We began to monitor the movements of other animals in the area especially that of tigers and sloth bears and continued to place appropriate amounts of chicken meat in the cave The cub showed up quite regularly Interestingly the camera trap images revealed that a civet had also begun to frequent the cave lured by the meat This delicate exercise continued for a month Then we decided to experiment a bit we placed a live chicken this time hung at a height of one metre We hoped this would ensure the civet couldnt reach it and encourage the cub to develop some hunting skills Amazingly it worked Soon we were placing two chickens instead of one as the cub grew Often the cub would disappear for a few days at a stretch and the monitoring staff would grow anxious until it showed up on the camera traps again We were relieved and pleased that we were able to successfully help the tiger cub survive on her own in the wild Usually tiger cubs stay with their mothers for the first two years of their lives Today the cub is a fully grown tigress that freely roams the reserve and fends for herself This challenging task taught us the importance of timely intervention using our wits and the importance of

songlines maps of the land and cultural history are woven through the ancient region one which First Australians have been living in and caring for over tens of thousands of years Today the flourishing area supports the livelihoods of 80 per cent of Australias human population while its striking natural scenery draws millions of tourists every year But this is also a region under immense pressure In the driest continent on Earth the mountainous spine of the Great Eastern Ranges traps moist air coming in from the Tasman Sea and converts it into muchneeded rainfall creating a reliable supply of fresh water This along with the regions rich soils and hospitable climate are drawing an increasing number of people resulting in rapid development and largescale clearing of habitat to make way for agricultural lands mining cities and infrastructure A greater glider Petauroides volans one of the worlds largest gliding mammals emerging from its nesting hollow in the GER Photo Josh Bowell To reverse the pervasive impacts of habitat loss fragmentation and degradation the Great Eastern Ranges GER initiative was established in 2007 It brings people together around a shared vision of wellconnected resilient and thriving communities landscapes and natural systems across eastern Australia GER serves as a backbone organisation engaging landholders local communities and traditional owners through its regional partnerships in projects that heal nature and provide holistic natural solutions to our climate biodiversity and wellbeing challenges This communitycentred approach ensures

Eastern Ranges GER hosts a rich biodiversity found nowhere else on Earth including unique and cryptic species Photo Great Eastern Ranges Ltd A New Challenge Already the impacts of climate change are exacerbating existing threats and resulting in unprecedented new challenges for Australia No event brought this into starker reality than the Black Summer bushfires of 2019 to 2020 Fuelled by a prolonged drought and widespread heatwaves the bushfires seared through 190000 sq km of eastern Australia impacting nearly 80 per cent of the population and killing and injuring a staggering three billion animals In the aftermath of the devastation GER pioneered a bushfire recovery programme to help nature and communities heal by repairing the land and natural systems upon which they depend Local school children in the KanangraBoyd to Wyangala Link section of the GER help to plant new habitat Photo Great Eastern Ranges Ltd To identify the places most in need and pool resources GER worked with researchers from Griffith University and the Australian National University in early 2020 to map the postfire footprint This resulted in the identification of several landscapes which would form the focus for onground efforts With the support of other environmental organisations and Australian federal and state governments GER has been working with partners over the past three years to roll out complementary bushfire recovery projects in these landscapes Australias Great Eastern Ranges The Great Eastern Ranges extend from southern Victoria to the north of Cairns parallel to the eastern coast of Australia The region encompasses two very old mountainous landscapes the Great Dividing Range and the Great Escarpment The Great Dividing Range is the main watershed of eastern Australia The 3700 kmlong range is a cordillera it comprises low mountain ranges uplands and plateaus The Blue Mountains National Park a nature reserve lies in this region The mountains apparently take their name from the bluish colour caused by the diffusion of light through oil droplets which are released by indigenous eucalyptus trees The Great Escarpment runs along almost the length of the eastern coast of the continent east of the Great Dividing Range for about 3600 km It is bisected in several places by rivers heading to the sea Returning Life To The Land Since early 2020 GER has been supporting local groups to engage bushfireaffected landholders communities and traditional owners in projects that heal country and return life to their land These scienceled activities are carefully tailored to meet the unique needs and priorities of each landholder and site As well as helping nature to recover the activities are providing people with a way to bounce back reconnect with country and build

33 No 1 January 2013 The truth about lions and cheetahs Captain Thomas Williamson the author of the epic book about Indias animals Oriental Field Sports says that in the 1780s while pigsticking you were only likely to encounter tigers that had strayed into the open but never lions or for that matter cheetahs He went on to state that after spending the last two decades of the 18th century roaming the wilderness of India he believed that there were no lions in Hindostan For me this was an excellent clue regarding the state of the lion during that time which was then a much debated topic In his book Wild Animals in Central India published in 1931 A A Dunbar Brander writes that there were no lions in central India and goes on to say of the cheetah that The hunting leopard Cynalurus jubatus has now almost entirely disappeared from the province without apparent reason and I only know of three animals having been procured in the last 20 years As we will see in the course of this book it is likely that what Brander referred to must have been three trained cheetahs imported from Africa Why is it that the comments about lions and cheetahs and their rarity remain unchanged over hundreds of years especially from people who travelled across India in search of game Why is it that there are hardly any pictures of lions as hunting trophies and the few that exist tend to have been taken after 1886 in Gir Where are the cheetahs in the hunters bags After all according to commentators hunters were responsible for destroying both these species As I researched my thesis I grew convinced that I had stumbled upon the biggest myth perpetrated about these two species in India Tigers and leopards were everywhere in the historical record whether written photographed or depicted in other visual forms but lions and cheetahs were almost invisible Even on those rare occasions when lions and cheetahs were seen their behaviour appeared forced and unnatural compared to what I had witnessed of both species in Africa As with the lion in India I believe there was never an Asiatic cheetah Rather this animal was an imported royal pet that escaped into the wild on several occasions and may have sometimes created small feral populations The evidence that my coauthors and I have unearthed in the course of our research and study has duly underlined the basic premise that I began this book with that the Indian or Asiatic lion and the Indian or Asiatic cheetah are not distinctive subspecies but are exotic aliens that live or lived in the land of the tiger For me this fact was made amply clear as I ploughed through hundreds of books and research papers on both the animals The numbers just didnt add up I found lesser and lesser encounters with lions and cheetahs the more I read Descriptions of both species were rare and both seemed to lack a tradition in India Tigers and leopards were all over the place lions and cheetahs in comparison were barely visible in the pages of history This book is the story of our search and raises serious questions about the ancestry and place of the lion and the cheetah in their natural state in India Exotic Aliens The Lion and Cheetah in India Author

between established national parks wildlife sanctuaries and reserved and protected forests of India Such areas are designated as conservation areas if they are uninhabited and completely owned by the Government of India or the State Government but used for subsistence by communities and community areas if part of the lands are privately owned These protected area categories were first introduced in the Wildlife Protection Amendment Act of 2002 the amendment to the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 These categories were added because of reduced protection in and around existing or proposed protected areas due to private ownership of land and land use There are 100 existing Conservation Reserves in India covering an area of 492728 km 2 which is 015 of the geographical area of the country

Home About Us Menu Toggle The Organization Board Of Directors Other Key Functionaries Advisers and Consultants Menu Toggle Overseas Advisers and Consultants National Advisers and Consultants Annual Report Services Our Achievements Get Involved Menu Toggle Volunteer Our Work Contact Us Development of Zonal Master Plans for Ecosensitive Zones of the Protected Areas Specific Frameworks for planning management and policy mechanisms have been evolved by the organisation to development of Zonal Master Plans for Ecosensitive Zones of Protected Areas Why are EcoSensitive Zones created According to the guidelines issued by the Environment Ministry on February 9 2011 ESZs are created as shock absorbers for the protected areas to minimize the negative impact on the fragile ecosystems by certain human activities taking place nearby Furthermore these areas are meant to act as a transition zone from areas requiring higher protection to those requiring lesser protection The basic aim is to regulate certain activities around National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries so as to minimise the negative impacts of such activities on the fragile ecosystems encompassing the protected areas Ecologically Sensitive Areas ESAs have been identified and notified by the Indian Ministry of Environment Forests MoEF since 1989 Notifications declaring areas as ESAs are issued under the Environment Protection Act 1986 The clauses of the EPA which allow for the notification of ESAs hold the possibility of realizing landscapelevel conservation Activities Allowed in ESZs Ecosensitive zones are open to development and allied activities however the activities taking place in ESZ are regularised Those activities that are found to have deleterious impact on the protected areas are prohibited those whose effect is not extremely harmful are allowed but regulated while certain activities are allowed Given below is a gist of activities falling in all the three categories discussed above Prohibited activities Commercial mining saw mills industries causing pollution air water soil noise etc establishment of major hydroelectric projects HEP commercial use of wood Tourism activities like hotair balloons over the National Park discharge of effluents or any solid waste or production of hazardous substances Regulated activities Felling of trees establishment of hotels and resorts commercial use of natural water erection of electrical cables drastic change of agriculture system eg adoption of heavy technology pesticides etc widening of roads Permitted activities Ongoing agricultural or horticultural practices rainwater harvesting organic farming use of renewable energy sources adoption of green technology for all activities Significance of ESZs The significance of ESZ has been briefly discussed below In order to minimise the impact of urbanisation and other developmental activities areas adjacent to protected areas have been declared as EcoSensitive Zones The purpose of declaring ecosensitive zones around protected areas is for creating a Shock Absorber for the protected area They also act as transition zones from areas of high protection to areas involving lesser protection ESZs help in insitu conservation which deals with conservation of an endangered species in its natural habitat EcoSensitive Zones minimise forest depletion and helps mitigate mananimal conflict Challenges and Threats to EcoSensitive Zones There are a number of challenges and threats to ESZs at the forefront are developmental activities especially those involving degradation of natural resources around the PAs Activities such as construction of dams roads urban and rural infrastructures in the ESZ create interference negatively impact upon the environment and creates an imbalance of the ecological system For example construction of road would lead to cutting down of trees which would further impact upon soil erosion thereby destroying the habitats of the species preserved under the ESZ Zonal Master Plans for ESZs The Scenario in India At a time when polluting industries like cement plants and mining projects are being pushed in the notified ecosensitive zones ESZ of wildlife sanctuaries and national parks and tiger corridors most of the states are yet to prepare and notify Zonal Master Plans ZMPs which regulates these detrimental units A Zonal Master Plan for the Ecosensitive Zone is supposed to be prepared by the State Government within a period of one year from the date of publication of this notification in the Official Gazette and submitted for approval to the Central Government in the Ministry of Environment and Forests Government of India It is mandatory for the state governments to prepare Zonal Master PlansZMP for ESZ as per the MoEFCC guidelines The ZMP is prepared in consultation with local people within two years from the date of ESZ notification in the official gazette The purpose of making the zonal plan is to regulate the developmental activities in the region in such a way that it ensures environmental and ecological protection of the entire endangered area Wildlife and We Protection Foundation Wildlife and We

why monitoring is taking place and how monitoring results will be used to produce intangible improvements in the effectiveness of conservation actions Monitoring is typically considered as mere research and consequently a luxury in protected area management Monitoring should be a central and operational component of all conservation management activities because if we cannot measure and assess what impact we are having on the conservation of biodiversity we can never adapt our assumptions and management practices and thus improve the effectiveness of our conservation actions Monitoring should not be considered a dispensable luxury but an essential tool for adaptively managing conservation actions as conditions change and we learn from our efforts Monitoring can be
