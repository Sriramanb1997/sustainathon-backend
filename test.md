**New Species of Elephants Under Research**

Elephants are well-known for their diversity, with three existing recognized species: the African Bush Elephant (*Loxodonta africana*), the African Forest Elephant (*Loxodonta cyclotis*), and the Asian Elephant (*Elephas maximus*). However, there is ongoing research suggesting that these species might not be exhaustive. Here are some new species or subpopulations under research:

1. **Forest Elephants Subspecies**
    - Some researchers argue that Forest Elephants should be considered a separate species due to their distinct genetic makeup and morphological differences from Bush Elephants.

2. **Sri Lankan Elephant** (*Elephas maximus maximus*)
    - Although considered a subspecies, some researchers propose that Sri Lankan Elephants should be classified as a distinct species due to their genetic and physical differences from other Asian Elephants.

3. **Sumatran Elephant** (*Elephas maximus sumatranus*)
    - Similar to Sri Lankan Elephants, Sumatran Elephants are often discussed as a potential distinct species due to their genetic uniqueness.

4. **Manas Elephant** (*Elephas maximus manensis*)
    - A proposed new species from the Manas National Park in Assam, India, based on genetic and morphological differences.
